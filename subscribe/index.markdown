There are a three ways you can subscribe to my articles and other writing.

* [Twitter/@apike](https://twitter.com/apike/), where I post my articles, plus other bleeps and bloops
* [RSS](/feed/), which in this case is technically Atom
* [JSON Feed](/feed.json), the latest in [feed technology](https://jsonfeed.org/)

You can also get an email newsletter whenever I publish an article.

<form class="newsletter" action="https://feed.press/e/mailverify" method="post"
target="popupwindow" onsubmit="window.open('https://feed.press/e/mailverify?feed_id=allenpike', 'popupwindow',
'scrollbars=yes,width=550,height=400');return true">
<input type="text" name="email" placeholder="Email address"/>
<input type="submit" value="Join Newsletter" />
<input type="hidden" value="allenpike" name="feed_id"/>
</form>

It is the style nowadays to send out newsletters as if they were correspondence &ndash; artisanal missives exclusively for subscribers. As nice as may be, my "newsletter" currently consists of a copy of each article I write, delivered to your inbox. Plain and simple.

There are a variety of ways you can subscribe to my articles and other writing.

* [Atom Feed](/feed/), for your favourite RSS reader
* JSON Feed, coming soon
* [@apike on Twitter](https://twitter.com/apike/), where I post my articles, plus other bleeps and bloops

You can also get an email newsletter whenever I publish an article.

<form class="newsletter" action="https://feed.press/e/mailverify" method="post"
target="popupwindow" onsubmit="window.open('https://feed.press/e/mailverify?feed_id=allenpike', 'popupwindow',
'scrollbars=yes,width=550,height=400');return true">
<input type="text" name="email" placeholder="Email address"/></p>
<input type="submit" value="Join Newsletter" />
<input type="hidden" value="allenpike" name="feed_id"/>
</form>

It is the style nowadays to send out newsletters as if they were correspondence &ndash; casual notes exclusively for folks on your mailing list. For now the newsletter just consists of a copy of each article I write, but I'm open to suggestions.

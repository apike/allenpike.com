([Back to about Altering Time](/altering-time/).)




One of the first features on Altering Time was a quotes database. Anybody could submit a quote, and vote whether other quotes sucked or rocked. My favourite thing about the quotes was that they were limited to 100 characters. This was years before Twitter, but the same pattern emerged: people complained about it, but it had a wonderful effect. Below are the top 50 quotes of all time from that system.

The Bridgeburners were a casual raid guild for World of Warcraft. From winter 2007 to spring 2009, we played together, learned together, and had fun. In Burning Crusade, we farmed Karazhan, finished some of Zul'Aman, and got Gruul down to 1%. In Wrath of the Lich King, we cleared Naxxramas. After that our cohesion got weaker - different people had different priorities, and the guild declined.

If you came here looking for a guild on Staghelm, many old Bridgeburners are in the guild Caffeine. I still miss those guys and gals, and you should check them out if you're into end-game raiding. If you came here wondering about the Bridgeburners who didn't join Caffeine, as of 2010 many of us still out of the MMO world.

For me, Bridgeburners was founded for having fun, game/life balance, a lack of drama, and trying to ignore the loot. Those goals are hard to achieve, in my experience, in WoW end-game raiding. Everything in life needs moderation, and it's hard to get the best out of an MMO in moderation. It's also hard to reconcile the times where you're not having fun with the fact it's just a game. Managing these, I think, is the trick.

Cheers,

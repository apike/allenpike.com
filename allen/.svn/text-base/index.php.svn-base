          I own allenpike.com, and I plan to have it redirect to whatever 
          my website is at the time, like, forever. So you can bookmark 
          allenpike.com, or you can bookmark my main website, 
          which is <a href="/">alteringtime.com</a>. 
          This page is part of Altering Time, and I encourage you to explore 
          the site. As for me, I'll put a little about me here, and then 
          leave it at that.</p>

          years old and live in Langley, British Columbia. I'm going to 
          university, and I'm a web programmer for <a href="http://www.discoverysoft.com/">Discovery Software.</a> My company, <b>Altering Time</b>, is doing quite 
          well. I'm doing lots of stuff on there, including an <a href="/asylum/">online 
          game</a> or <a href="/faith/">two</a>. Aldergrovians should check out <a href="/silliness/wetfloor.php">Wet 
          Floor Signs</a>, one of the few places you can see Parkside 
         Waterpark online!</div>

    I'm currently working for <a href="http://www.discoverysoft.com/">Discovery Software</a>,

          main website, antipode.ca, in my Grad writeup in the yearbook 
          for <b>ACSS Grad 2002</b>. When I got allenpike.com, it was 
          too late to change. High five to everyone from ACSS who bothered 
          to check it out and managed to find this, or people who followed 
          the link I signed on the wall in the drama room. You might want 
          to check out the <a href="../forum/">Forum</a>, as there's lots 
          of people from ACSS (and others from around the world) there.

          it is</a>. Also, here's the <b>script</b> for the play

          Pathetic, isn't it? That's why I got allenpike.com so you don't 
          have to remember anymore! Mind you I do technically have an <a href='http://www.sfu.ca/~apike/'>SFU page</a>,
          	but since I don't use it I won't count it as a "past address".</p>

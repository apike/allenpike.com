        <h1>Theatre Company Movie?"5 Years"</h1>
		<p>
          5 years worth of memories of the Aldergrove 
          theatre program will be with me forever. I took on a video project that 
          took a few dozen times more (literally) work, stress, and frustration 
          than I'd planned, the climax (but not end) of which was my screaming 
          "Fuck!" to a hundred or so parents, grandparents, and school 
          administrators when my computer quit during the first screening. Anyway, 
          here's a much compressed web movie version.</p>

        <p class="defaultText"><span class="headline">The File</span>


<?php
print "<p>Because of the crazy amounts of visitors we're getting this month, I've removed the link to my movie for now. I would like to write a \"smart\" page that will let people watch the movie as long as we're not in danger of running out of bandwith that month. I'll keep you posted. :)</p>";

          The 21 megabyte Quicktime movie file has some important things to keep 
          in mind about it. First, you<b> need to have Quicktime 5 or 6</b> installed 
          on your computer. If you have a Mac, you're covered (go Sam!) but otherwise 
          you <i>might</i> need to click and <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">download 
          Quicktime 6</a> for free. Second, <b>21 megabytes is huge</b>. Over 
          dial up internet (the slow kind that makes a "wwoeoe oeoe oeooe 
          rrrr KSSSSHHH!" sound when it's connecting) it'll take hours to 
          load. Over fast internet, it'll probably load faster that it can play. 
          If you have slow internet, you'll want to save the file to your hard 
          drive instead of letting it load in this page. Right-click on <a href="/files/movies/fysmall.mov">this 
          link to the file</a> and choose "Save Target As..." or "Download 
          link to disk.." or something like that. You can also download it 
          to disk if you want to stretch it and <b>make it bigger</b> on your 
          screen (the browser plugin can't do that...)</p>

        <p class="defaultText"><span class="headline">The Horror Story</span><br />
          The making of this movie began months ago, so I've begun to block it 
          from my mind. Here, though, are the most pivotal of a solid few dozen 
          technical difficulties.</p>
        <p class="defaultText"> Long before project start time, our video camera 
          died. No problem; we sent it to Langley Schools' fix-it guy, Vern. Was 
          that ever a mistake. It took me about five calls over the span of <b>5 
          months</b> to get the camera back. Always some pinner ass excuse. Finally 
          we got the camera back.</p>
        <p class="defaultText">After less than an hour of having the camera, it 
          <b>died again</b>, from merely being held. There was no option but to 
          send it back... to... Vern...</p>
        <p class="defaultText">When we finally got the camera back the second 
          time, I found we had <b>no cable</b> for connecting the computer to 
          the camera, which had to be done before I film more than a bit of people 
          fooling around. That took a couple weeks for me to give up and buy one 
          (right after which we found the old cable.) At this point I have 4 days 
          until the screening for everyone at Awards Night.</p>
        <p class="defaultText">3 days left, on a Saturday. Now is the time to 
          begin getting footage from videos of past plays. All is going well, 
          except that the power cord came out of my bag at school. I have <b>one 
          hour</b> of battery time for the whole weekend.</p>
        <p class="defaultText">Some time into my hour of battery, the camera <b>died</b>, 
          as it had the last two times. I almost died too. After three hours of 
          fiddling and messing with it, I manage to get it working, but it dies 
          whenever I open the viewfinder, which covers vital controls. So I need 
          a new battery.</p>
        <p class="defaultText">2 days left. Find out a battery costs almost <b>$200</b>. 
          I almost die again. I manage to develop a method with a toothpick and 
          tweezers to use the vital controls without opening the viewfinder enough 
          to turn it on.</p>
        <p class="defaultText">The camera <b>runs out of battery</b> a few minutes 
          later.</p>
        <p class="defaultText">Day before screening. Haul everything to school 
          and begin pulling footage from videos and interviewing people. Camera 
          dies <b>periodically</b> througout day. Keep <b>running out of disk 
          space</b> on my computer. For no good goddamn reason, iMovie stops doing 
          fonts properly (it makes them all pixelized and crappy now).</p>
        <p class="defaultText">Day of screening. Skip all my classes and work 
          on the video all day. Lots of little technical problems. I realize I 
          have like 18 minutes of music and 8 minutes of footage. Frantically 
          try and fix that. Running out of time. Have to work before Awards Night. 
          Am almost done. Bring movie to work and finish it there.</p>
        <p class="defaultText">Sam's car breaks down so I'm at work until the 
          show starts (my movie is last). Backstage I'm frantically trying to 
          put the video back on the camera so I can hook it to the projector.</p>
        <p class="defaultText">Intermission. Most stressful time of my life for 
          those 20 minutes. Find out we have <b>no hookup</b> from camera to projector. 
          Go crazy trying to get cables and hookups to connect computer to camera 
          directly. Turn projector on but we can't turn off the blue glow all 
          over the stage. The movie screen isn't down. Mom has to go home to fetch 
          an audio cable.</p>
        <p class="defaultText">During all this, I'm frantically trying to organize 
          my own <b>play</b> that goes on soon, as well as the one I'm in. Lots 
          of people are asking me for help with other things.</p>
        <p class="defaultText">I run up to the booth as intermission ends and 
          put my computer up there, telling nobody in particular to plug it in. 
          The fact nobody in particular heard was the <b>fatal blow</b>.</p>
        <p class="defaultText">After I survive the emotion of the play I'm in 
          (my girlfriend <b>dies</b> of a drug overdose) and all the awards and 
          the knowledge this is our last time, I go upstairs to start the video, 
          so glad it's almost over. My computer is at 0% battery and <b>sleeping</b>.</p>
        <p class="defaultText">We plug my computer in so it's not running on battery, 
          and hook it up. The amp isn't on though, so <b>no sound</b>.</p>
        <p class="defaultText">The<b> video also doesn't work</b>. I have to reboot 
          my computer for it to recoginze the projector as a monitor.</p>
        <p class="defaultText">So far the audience has been waiting like <b>20 
          minutes</b>. The amp is on, on max, but no sound. No sound if we plug 
          in Mike's computer either. No sound. No #$!@*# sound. After hours of 
          this, we find out that we can route the sound to the booth speaker, 
          which the audience can't really hear but there's nothing I can do.</p>
        <p class="defaultText">The movie starts, but wait a second... it's still 
          at 0% battery. <b>It's not charging</b>. The plug isn't working that 
          we've stuck it in. Neither do any other plugs. Caitlin is trying frantically 
          to get it to charge, but it's sporatic. The audience keeps seeing "You 
          computer will soon go to sleep if you don't plug it in" warnings<b> 
          on top of the movie</b>. I keep having to stop the movie to clear them.</p>
        <p class="defaultText">As the movie just starts to get to the really good 
          part... the part where everybody's supposed to be emotional and I feel 
          good about what I've done, <b>the computer goes to sleep</b>. No power. 
          I can't wake it up. It's dead. My profanity is heard louder and clearer 
          than the movie had been heard seconds ago. I dismiss the audience and 
          cry like a schoolgirl.</p>
        <p class="defaultText">This isn't the end of the problems, but the climax. 
          The next day there's maybe a dozen new problems as we try and reshow 
          it for TComp, such as the volume won't go high enough, and my computer 
          going to sleep because it's not in use,<b> during the video</b>.</p>

<p>Trying 
          to put it up on the website has also been quite an ordeal, and I uploaded 
          one version finally which didn't work at all for no good reason. When this page was finally working and people were looking at it (the night before I was leaving on vacation at 3AM) I started getting an email every ten minutes about how close the site was to getting shut down for excessive traffic (starting at 95% of maximum and going up.) I could have taken this page down, but didn't just because I couldn't let it win.</p>
        <p class="defaultText">The moral of the story is... if you're doing the 
          movie next year Tessa, <b>KEEP ME FAR AWAY FROM IT!</b> I'm cursed, 
          and that's the way it is.</p>
        <p class="defaultText">The bright side is, if I can resist the urge to 
          give up, or even better kill myself, during that, I think I can do anything.</p>

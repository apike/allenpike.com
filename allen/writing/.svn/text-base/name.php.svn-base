      <p  align="left"><i>At a bus stop. Jack and Lucas 
        are sitting on the bench, two graduated teens. Long silence.</i></p>
      <p  align="left"><b>Jack:</b> This is gay.<br />
        <b>Lucas:</b> No it&#146;s not.<br />
        <b>Jack:</b> Pause. Sure it is. We&#146;ve been sitting here doing crap 
        all for almost an hour now.<br />
        <b>Lucas:</b> I don&#146;t see how that could make something &#147;gay&#148;, 
        Jack.<br />
        <b>Jack:</b> You know what I meant.<br />
        <b>Lucas:</b> What you mean is less important than what you say. Besides, 
        we&#146;re doing lots of things.<br />
        <b>Jack:</b> Like sitting. And rotting.<br />
        <b>Lucas:</b> Technically, yes. But we&#146;re not here to &#147;rot&#148;. 
        We&#146;re here to investigate.<br />
        <b>Jack:</b> <i>Sulks</i>. How do we know this girl we&#146;re supposed 
        to investigate even exists?<br />
        <b>Lucas:</b> Why the hell would he pay us to investigate her if she 
        doesn&#146;t exist? That&#146;d be a pretty stupid waste of money.<br />
        <b>Jack:</b> It wouldn&#146;t be a waste of money if she didn&#146;t 
        exist, because we wouldn&#146;t be able to investigate her, so 
        he wouldn&#146;t pay us!<br />
        <b>Lucas:</b> <i>Sarcastically.</i> Yay! That way he could get no service 
        whatsoever, for free! What a genius!<br />
        <b>Jack:</b> Stop mocking me.<br />
        <b>Lucas:</b> Stop letting me.<br />
        <b>Jack:</b> You&#146;re gay.<br />
        <b>Lucas:</b> <i>Notices Natasha approaching.</i> We&#146;ll see about 
        that.</p>
      <p  align="left"><i>Natasha sits on the other end 
        of the bench, self-absorbed.</i></p>
      <p  align="left"><b>Jack:</b> <i>Aside.</i> That&#146;s 
        the girl, right? This is the time he said she&#146;d be here.<br />
        <b>Lucas:</b> No, it&#146;s the Queen of Sheba.<br />
        <b>Jack:</b> <i>Confused pause.</i> What&#146;re we investigating again?<br />
        <b>Lucas:</b> <i>Pulls out a slip of paper. Frowns.</i> This says he 
        just wants her name. This should only take a minute. <i>To Natasha</i>. 
        Hey there beautiful... <i>Natasha gives him an acid glare.</i> 
        My name is Lucas, but you can call me, tonight. <i>Natasha rolls 
        her eyes and stands up.</i><br />
        <b>Jack:</b> Smooth.<br />
        <b>Lucas:</b><i> Arches eyebrow.</i> What was that you said to the last 
        girl? Oh yeah. &#147;Were you arrested earlier? &#145;Cause it&#146;s 
        gotta be illegal to look that good.&#148;<br />
        <b>Jack:</b> Shutup.<br />
        <b>Lucas:</b> You said it, not me.<br />
        <b>Jack:</b> I... I was joking, kay? <i>Gets up. To Natasha.</i> You 
        look familiar. Do I know you? What&#146;s your...<br />
        <b>Natasha:</b> No, you don&#146;t know me. How is it that when guys 
        get lonely, we seem more familiar to them? <i>Stares down a stuttering 
        Jack.</i><br />
        <b>Jack:</b> <i>Sits down again. </i>Ow. Icebreakers don&#146;t seem 
        to be working.<br />
        <b>Lucas:</b> Of course not. This is a glacier.<br />
        <b>Jack:</b> Well it shouldn&#146;t be too hard, I mean... to just get 
        her name...<br />
        <b>Lucas:</b> <i>Steeples his fingers.</i> This is important. He&#146;ll 
        never trust us again if we mess this up. Her bus will be here 
        in a couple minutes.<br />
        <b>Jack:</b> Yeah. I mean, how hard can it be to get a girl&#146;s name?<br />
        <b>Natasha:</b> <i>Phone rings. Opens it and listens for awhile. </i>Well 
        I&#146;ve had enough of this crap! I don&#146;t care if you have 
        to use slave labour! I don&#146;t know any slaves. I want the 
        shipment ON TIME.<i> Closes phone.</i><br />
        <b>Jack:</b><i> Coughs. Pause.</i> I&#146;m hungry.<br />
        <b>Lucas:</b> That&#146;s great. We&#146;ll eat... after we get paid... 
        after we get this bitch&#146;s name.<br />
        <b>Jack:</b> Don&#146;t call her a bitch.<br />
        <b>Lucas:</b> <i>Arches eyebrow.</i> Slave labour?<br />
        <b>Jack:</b> I&#146;m sure, inside, she&#146;s a good person. <i>Goes 
        over.</i> Miss, I was wondering if you could just tell me your 
        name.<br />
        <b>Natasha:</b> Sir, I was wondering if you could get lost.<br />
        <b>Lucas:</b> <i>Pulls Jack away confidently.</i> Lovely lady. I have 
        to say, you are the most beautiful woman I have ever laid my eyes 
        upon. I would be the happiest man on earth if only...<br />
        <b>Natasha:</b> Don&#146;t bother. I&#146;ve heard it all before, and 
        I&#146;m not interested.<br />
        <b>Lucas:</b> What? Oh... no, it&#146;s not like that. I just wanted...<br />
        <b>Natasha:</b> I have pepper spray!<br />
        <b>Lucas:</b> Okay! Chill... <i>Sits down beside Jack.</i> What time 
        is it?<br />
        <b>Jack:</b><i> Checks watch.</i> 2:29. We&#146;re screwed.<br />
        <b>Lucas:</b><i> Glances at Natasha. </i>Soo screwed... our reputation...<br />
        <b>Jack:</b> Our food...<br />
        <b>Natasha:</b> Will you shut up!<br />
        <b>Jack:</b> Why don&#146;t you shut up?<br />
        <b>Lucas:</b> Buddy...<br />
        <b>Jack:</b> No! I&#146;ve had it with you. I&#146;ve been around you 
        for all of five minutes, and I already hate you. It&#146;s people 
        like you who make the world the craphole it is now! You think 
        that just because you&#146;re beautiful, you can treat anyone 
        however you want! Well that&#146;s selfish and cruel. I cringe 
        to think of how many guys with good intentions you&#146;ve taken 
        and ripped their hearts out. Just stomped and stomped on them 
        like there&#146;s no tomorrow. Well that&#146;s not... not... 
        good!<br />
        <b>Natasha:</b> Quietly. What... what do you want?<br />
        <b>Lucas:</b> To tell you the truth, all we wanted was to know your name.<br />
        <b>Jack:</b> But you don&#146;t care! You don&#146;t realize that we&#146;re 
        people too... that I have needs and and Lucas has needs and that 
        guy on the other side of the street going through the trash has 
        needs... You don&#146;t care that he needs to, to survive. You 
        don&#146;t care if your name means our groceries, or our phone 
        bill, or cat crunchies. You don&#146;t care that every time a 
        beautiful girl mocks us we cry inside...<br />
        <b>Lucas:</b> <i>Quietly</i>. Buddy... give it up...<br />
        <b>Jack:</b><i> Looks to both.</i> Your bus is coming. Good day. <i>Starts 
        walking off with Lucas.</i><br />
        <b>Natasha:</b> <i>Long pause.</i> Natasha. My... name is Natasha.<i> 
        Gets on the bus. The guys watch silently. Blackout.</i></p>

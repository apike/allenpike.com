          the park where Sasha and Steve go when they want to talk. They&#146;re

          <br />
          <b>Steve:</b> We&#146;re here.<br />
          <b>Sasha:</b> Yeah.<br />
          <b>Steve:</b> It&#146;s been awhile since we were here.<br />
          <b>Sasha:</b> You&#146;re right. It was probably after you and Corina.<br />
          <b>Steve:</b> Yeah. I really want to thank you for helping me through 
          that... and everything.<br />
          <b>Sasha:</b> <i>Smiles.</i> Yeah. This place has seen a lot of comforting.<br />
          <b>Steve:</b> I really wanted to tell you...<br />
          <b>Sasha:</b> <i>Wary. </i>What&#146;s that?<br />
          <b>Steve:</b> That... <i>Pause. </i>You&#146;re a really great friend.<br />
          <b>Sasha:</b> Oh. Okay. <i>Freezes.</i><br />
          <b>Steve:</b> <i>To audience. Sighs.</i> I can&#146;t keep going like 
          this... it&#146;s tearing me apart. There has to be an easier 
          way.<i><br />

          Blackout. Steve and Sasha enter.</i><br />
          <br />
          <b>Steve:</b> We&#146;re here.<br />
          <b>Sasha:</b> Yeah.<br />
          <b>Steve:</b> It&#146;s been awhile since we were here.<br />
          <b>Sasha:</b> You&#146;re right. It was probably after you and Corina.<br />
          <b>Steve:</b> <i>Nods. Pause.</i> I always knew we would be here on 
          Grad night.<br />
          <b>Sasha:</b> <i>Blinks.</i> How? We only decided to go together a 
          couple months ago.<br />
          <b>Steve:</b> I just always kind of knew...<br />
          <b>Sasha:</b> Yeah. I&#146;d actually always thought I&#146;d go with 
          my boyfriend at the time. Obviously that plan was a failure.<br />
          <b>Steve:</b> I don&#146;t think it&#146;s a failure.<br />
          <b>Sasha:</b> My entire high school life was a failure. <i>Freezes.</i><br />
          <b>Steve:</b> <i>To audience.</i> Okay, okay, okay. This isn&#146;t 
          working at all. After three years you&#146;d think I would have 
          figured out how to tell her things, but no. I&#146;M the failure. 
          <i>Sigh.</i> Let&#146;s try this again.<br />
          <br />
          <i>Blackout. Steve and Sasha enter.</i><br />
          <br />
          <b>Steve:</b> We&#146;re here.<br />
          <b>Sasha:</b> Yeah.<br />
          <b>Steve:</b> I like it here. That I only come here with you makes 
          it... special.<br />
          <b>Sasha:</b> <i>Smiles.</i> I know what you mean... what do you want 
          to do?<br />
          <b>Steve:</b> <i>Pause.</i> Kiss you. <i>Shocked that he said that.</i><br />
          <br />
          <i>Sasha freezes.</i><br />
          <br />
          <b>Steve:</b> Okay, that was even worse. I can&#146;t even believe 
          I said that. How about...<br />
          <br />
          <i>Blackout. Steve and Sasha enter.</i><br />
          <br />
          <b>Steve:</b> We&#146;re here.<br />
          <b>Sasha:</b> Yeah.<br />

          <b>Steve:</b> Sasha.... there&#146;s something you need to know...<br />
          <b>Sasha:</b> <i>Wary. </i>What&#146;s that?<br />
          <b>Steve:</b> Ryan will tell you.<br />
          <br />
          <i>Ryan enters. Sasha is taken aback.</i><br />
          <br />
          Ryan: Sasha... you inspire me... make me complete. Your eyes 
          are like pools of moonlight, and your voice of silk. I can&#146;t 
          live my life anymore away from your embrace. <i>Holds her.</i><br />
          <b>Sasha:</b> Ryan... that&#146;s beautiful. <i>Walks up to him, and 
          goes to kiss him, when Steve interrupts and Ryan and Sasha both 
          freeze.</i><br />
          <b>Steve:</b> Enough of that! <i>Hits Ryan&#146;s frozen head.</i> 
          Maybe... maybe I can show her how I feel...<br />
          <br />
          <i>Blackout. Steve and Sasha enter. Pause.</i><br />
          <br />
          <b>Sasha:</b> What are you thinking?<br />
          <b>Steve:</b> <i>Kisses her.</i> That.<br />
          <b>Sasha:</b> <i>Confused.</i> I... you...<br />
          <b>Steve:</b> Was that bad?<br />
          <b>Sasha:</b> It wan&#146;t bad, it was just... I don&#146;t think... 
          It&#146;s like kissing my... <i>Freezes.</i><br />
          <b>Steve:</b> Your brother. I&#146;m not your brother. <i>Sits down.</i> 
          Why am I everyone&#146;s brother?<br />
          <br />
          <i>Blackout. Steve and Sasha enter.</i><br />
          <br />
          <b>Steve:</b> We&#146;re here. Don&#146;t say &#145;Yeah&#146;.<br />
          <b>Sasha:</b> What?<br />
          <b>Steve:</b> Theoretically, if I wanted to tell you I loved you, how 
          would I go about it?<br />
          <b>Sasha:</b> <i>Confused.</i> What? Are you trying to tell me something?<br />
          <b>Steve:</b> Yes! Yes I am! I have been for months!<br />
          <b>Sasha:</b> We just got here...<br />
          <b>Steve:</b> <i>Stares at her for awhile.</i> If I was so inclined... 
          How would I tell you I loved you, if I didn&#146;t want you 
          to feel weird?<br />
          <b>Sasha:</b> <i>Pause.</i> You wouldn&#146;t.<br />
          <b>Steve:</b> Of course I would.<br />
          <b>Sasha:</b> <i>Steps closer and touches his face.</i> You don&#146;t 
          need to. <i>Kisses his cheek. Pauses. She freezes.</i><br />
          <b>Steve:</b> Huh....<br />
          <br />

<h1>Allen's Writing</h1>

<p>Here is where I put things I've written that for some reason or another
got posted online. I write lots of things for different reasons, but sometimes
somebody will request one, so I just put it here so they can read it.</p>

<p><b><a href="name.php">A Name</a></b> - A script written and directed
for Directing &amp; Scriptwriting 12. Short, said to be cute.</p>

<p><b><a href="script.php">A Thought</a></b> - My first script 
for Directing &amp; Scriptwriting 12. Also short and cute.</p>

<p><b><a href="rfid.php">Next-gen barcodes track your every move</a></b> - My first published newspaper article, from my first year of university.</p>

<p><b><a href="secondperson.php">Second person, present tense story</a></b> - My grade 10 English teacher said it couldn't be done, so of course I had to.</p>

<p><b><a href="fairytale.php">Fairy Tale</a></b> - One of the more odd fairy tales you'll come across. I wrote this during Grade 11 while quite tired and bored.</p>

  <p class="pageTitle">Second Person Story by Allen</p>
  <p class="defaultText"> 
  <p align="left">Ooh! Look who it is! Read my story, do you? Don't be 
    denying it, I have proof! The silent type, eh? I think we can soon 
    remedy that. I've written a little story; but not in first person—no, 
    that won't do at all. Third person is way too overdone. So I will 
    take the path not often traveled: second person…</p>
  <p align="left">You stand in the dark; a wet, cold dark. A liquid is 
    pouring down from above, so you assume it is rain. But how do you 
    know? You'd like to just believe its rain, for that is easier. Where 
    are you? Not knowing angers you. So you look around. Of course.</p>
  <p align="left">Being dark, you can't see very much. The liquid is making 
    puddles everywhere, splashing and dripping to no end. To your sides 
    are infernal cliffs. What if you wanted to go that way? Of course 
    you don't, but you dislike any limitation on your freedom. You appear 
    to be on a path—where the path comes from is not known to you, but 
    wherever it is, you don't like it. A place of evil. But how much less 
    evil is on the path ahead? Foolish to think of, for you're not going 
    back, so it doesn't matter.</p>
  <p align="left">As you step forwards, you notice your shoes are filled 
    with water. You didn't put water in your shoes! What an outrage! Obviously 
    someone must have done it to spite you. Fool.</p>
  <p align="left">You look up to see what appears to be a palace. Well, 
    not as much of a palace, but more like a run-down shack. There must 
    have been a dirty trick or you would have noticed that in the first 
    place. At this time, you feel a wet breeze on your cheek. Because 
    it is not warm, you assume it is cold. Cold.</p>
  <p align="left">You approach the shack, your mouth turns in disgust. 
    You hate this shack, with its fractured windows and black shingles 
    spread around the muddy ground. The grass is unkempt, the shutters 
    unhinged, and whatever paint there once was has worn away. The leaves 
    of last fall still litter the yard, along with the leaves of many 
    past falls, maybe since the beginning of time—but probably not.</p>
  <p align="left">You are angered by this shack. It's run-down and dirty 
    and destroys the beauty of the neighborhood, along with the mud and 
    rain and dark. You should give the owner a piece of your mind. Common 
    courtesy dictates that one cleans up before guests arrive—you are 
    a guest, obviously one of more importance than this shack deserves. 
    You always tidy up before having visitors, though you cannot recall 
    having any. Has nobody ever visited you?! How insulting!</p>
  <p align="left">As you knock on the door—or maybe before—someone opens 
    it. It is not a woman, so you assume it is a man. There might be a 
    third possibility, but you loathe to think of it. The man is ugly 
    and dirty and run-down. Just like something else you'd seen recently, 
    but you can't remember what. Why is this man smiling? How dare he 
    smile at you, with his crooked yellow teeth. Fools. Him and all his 
    friends—and his dog.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;I could kiss you,&quot; he mutters, and you slap 
    him. He doesn't notice, but neither do you. As you step inside, he 
    hisses, &quot;Come in, come in.&quot; How dare he tell you what to 
    do? Did he not see you were doing that already? Every person you've 
    met tonight has been a fool—and still is.</p>
  <p align="left">It seems it is no longer raining. But you are no fool. 
    It is still raining, but the rainy air is being kept out by the roof. 
    Or was the rainless air being kept in by the ceiling? You're infuriated 
    by not knowing. You fight the urge to kill the man, though you don't 
    know why.</p>
  <p align="left">The man starts to make his way downstairs. But he does 
    not run, walk or crawl like a normal person, but skips. He prances 
    like a fool; how cross he makes you. You scowl and look around, deciding 
    that there is no other course of action but to follow the fool.</p>
  <p align="left">So you follow the fool. You take the stairs, but you 
    are not so sure if they are 'down' stairs; you are not going down 
    nor up, nor any of the directions you are familiar with. After a while 
    that is of considerable length, you are downstairs. Well, you aren't 
    sure if it really is down, but that is what the fool keeps muttering, 
    &quot;Now we're downstairs.&quot; On second thought, because the fool 
    thinks it's downstairs, you decide it's upstairs; how dare he prance 
    like that. You decide to look around, because you think that you will 
    discover more with your eyes than with your ears, nose and tongue.</p>
  <p align="left">The upstairs of the fool's one-story shack is a bad 
    place. You don't know why, but it doesn't matter. Chemicals are boiling. 
    Animals are in cages. Fires are burning. The fool is prancing. All 
    things you disapprove of. If the fool tries to boil you or cage you 
    or burn you or prance you, then you will have to kill him. He makes 
    you so angry!</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;Sit here, my pretty,&quot; he mutters. You assume 
    it was him because it wasn't you, nor was it the chemicals or animals 
    or the fires. How dare he call you that? You are in no way his, though 
    you sometimes think of yourself as pretty. You kill him; twice. That 
    solves the problem.</p>
  <p align="left">He continues to babble on about how you should sit there, 
    where he gestures, so you just do so you don't have to hear his voice. 
    It's so loud and flowery and quiet and dark in here. He's whispering 
    that it will all be over soon, which is fine by you, since you never 
    even gave it permission to start!</p>
  <p align="left">Sitting here, you get an odd feeling. At least it was 
    not an even feeling, nor was it a prime number. In any case, the man 
    started pouring chemicals and chanting, flicking switches…and prancing!!!</p>
  <p align="left">If you weren't busy sitting, you would curse at him, 
    though that would be much less than he deserved. You must knock some 
    sense into this fool. You are both inraged and outraged. He begins 
    spewing gibberish—he's lost it!—and you begin shouting back in rage. 
    He must be quiet! What experiment is he talking about? If he tries 
    an experiment on you, then you'll kill him again! Cross doesn't begin 
    to describe it!</p>
  <p align="left">You wake up in a funny little room. How did you get 
    here? There's white everywhere… Why? The man is there, talking to 
    someone. &quot;Yes, this subject is clearly mad.&quot; The prancing 
    fool was no longer prancing, but wearing a white coat, and he had 
    a clipboard. You wish you had a clipboard. What does he mean you are 
    mad? You shout that you aren't mad anymore, that you forgive him, 
    but he slaps you. You both notice, but only you care. The man is the 
    mad one, it seems. He's mad at you.</p>
  <p align="left">&quot;How dare you speak to me like that?&quot; he demands. 
    He says you're dotty and you deserve to be locked up here. Where is 
    'here'? You try to put your hands over your ears, but something's 
    holding them together. If the wall wasn't soft, you would have been 
    knocked unconscious. It's not you who's mad, it's the prancing fool.</p>

title: Speaking and Podcasts
---

I enjoy teaching and telling stories, especially around software design and development. I've been lucky enough to be invited to do so at a couple dozen conferences and podcasts over the years. If you run a conference or podcast and would like to chat, [get in touch](/contact/).

I usually teach the same kinds of topics that I [write about](/archive): what I’ve been learning as I build products and teams. Most often I talk about product, design, applying LLMs, lessons learned, engineering leadership, or startups.

Also, on occasion, I'll MC a conference or show. 

### Videos

Here are some talks I've given:

title: Speaking and Podcasts
---

I enjoy teaching and telling stories, especially around software design and development. I've been lucky enough to be invited to do so at a couple dozen conferences and podcasts over the years. If you run a conference or podcast and would like to chat, [get in touch](/contact/).

### Topics

I often speak on the same topics that I [write about](/archive). Here are some examples:

* **Product and project management for quality**, including [communication](/2017/principle-of-least-surprise/), iteration, and what it takes to drive great UX.
* **Mobile app design and development**, especially topics around UI and product strategy.
* **Lessons learned from shipping products**, whether it was our app that [mapped the internet](http://www.steamclock.com/blog/2013/03/mapping-the-internet/), our various internal product experiments, or one of the dozens of products we've shipped for clients.
* **Engineering leadership**, including [engaging and retaining](/2017/feedback-mountain/) a team, technical decision-making, and advocating for quality.
* **Running a business**, especially a software business.
* **Personal stories** that inform, whether they're [heavy](/2017/bright-side-of-the-moon/) or [light](/2014/feeding-the-baby/).

Also, on occasion, I'll MC a conference or show. 

### Videos

Here are three example videos of talks I've given:

### Podcasts

I enjoy guesting on podcasts &ndash; they're most of the fun of giving a talk, with a lot less work. Here are some shows I've been on:

* [The Omni Show 64](https://theomnishow.omnigroup.com/episode/how-allen-pike-uses-omnifocus-to-run-steamclock), where I talk about how I manage tasks, and focusing on what's important rather than just urgent.

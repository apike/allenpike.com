I like hearing from people. You can send me feedback, criticism, suggestions, speaking invitations, photos of cute animals, love letters, or whatever. I typically respond within a few days.

There are three ways to contact me:

* [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/apike/) for the modern
* [Email](mailto:comments@allenpike.com), for the old school
* [via Steamclock](http://www.steamclock.com/contact/), for work inquiries

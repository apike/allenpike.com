I like hearing from people. 👋🏼 You can send me feedback, criticism, suggestions, invitations, questions, or animated gifs.

These are the best ways to contact me:

* <a href="https://mastodon.social/@apike" rel="me">@apike on Mastodon</a>, or <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/allenpike.com" rel="me">Bluesky</a>, for brevity
* Or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/allenpike/" rel="me">LinkedIn</a>, if you're like that
* [comments@allenpike.com](mailto:comments@allenpike.com), for the old school

I aspire to respond within a few days, especially for messages that are brief!

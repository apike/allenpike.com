Next week, we'll be kicking off a new speaker series in Vancouver called [Infer](https://lu.ma/infer). The goal of the meetup is to bring together folks who are doing technical AI engineering work, so we can learn from one another.

The [format will be familiar](https://allenpike.com/2010/howto-start-a-technical-meetup) to folks that have attended my previous meetups: two speakers, often one of whom will be visiting from out of town, with time to chat afterward. Events will happen roughly every couple months, when we have compelling topics lined up.

Technical meetups and speaker series are often worthwhile, but they're extremely valuable when the relevant technology is changing rapidly. We'll have a lot to talk about!

If you're building LLM-powered apps in Vancouver, you can [subscribe to our event on Luma](https://lu.ma/infer). There are still a few spots open for our first "beta" event on October 9th, and we'll be hosting another during NeurIPS in December.

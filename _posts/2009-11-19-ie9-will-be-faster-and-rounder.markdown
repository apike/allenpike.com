The Internet Explorer team has given [their first look](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2009/11/18/an-early-look-at-ie9-for-developers.aspx) at what web standards advances they're making for IE9. So far they're committed to big performance gains, rounded corners, and CSS3 selectors. This is a big deal because it's the first time Microsoft has implemented a new working draft web standard in many many years.

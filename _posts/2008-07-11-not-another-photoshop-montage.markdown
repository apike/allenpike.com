![](/images/wp-uploads/2008/07/iphone3g1.jpg)I've seen some really bad cell phone ads recently that are clearly just a bunch of product shots thrown into Photoshop with reflections added. In contrast, the [homepage](http://apple.com) of Apple.com today shows some attention to detail: the unseen back logo of the leaning iPhone is actually reflecting off of the one it's leaning on. Whether it's bothering to take a shot just for the ad or solid Photoshop skills, it's nice to see the attention to detail.

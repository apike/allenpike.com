![The lickable manila envelope logo.](/images/wp-uploads/2009/09/iworkcom.jpg)iWork '09 Update 3 launched today, featuring some updates to iWork.com. It's still in beta, but we ((Insert standard disclaimer that "we" does not imply I speak for my employer here.)) made some solid improvements on our initial release from earlier this year. The changes include password protection and HTTPS, server-side emails for invites and new comment notifications, a full landing page at [iwork.com](http://www.iwork.com/), some design tweaks, and performance enhancements with large documents.Â It's been fun pushing the boundaries of JavaScript and CSS with a great team.

Onward!

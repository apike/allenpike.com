The first meeting of the [Vancouver Javascript Developers group](http://www.meetup.com/vancouver-javascript-developers/) (VanJS) is one week away. Vancouver has a lot of smart people working with open web technologies, and judging by how much interest I've gotten in this first event, quite a few of them might be there next Wednesday. I'll be giving a talk on Thick-Client Javascript, and Brian, Rob, and Brock from Nitobi will be presenting XUI for mobile JS development. [Check out the Meetup event](http://www.meetup.com/vancouver-javascript-developers/calendar/11420480/) to get details and RSVP - hope to see you there if you're in town.

[Facebook has changed the rules around Applications](http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10199482130) to combat invite spam. It's about damn time - I broke 100 waiting application requests today. For example, you can now block an application from ever interacting with you again - why did this take so long? The most interesting, though, is this:


> Your feedback now determines how many communications an application can send. When invitations and notifications are ignored, blocked, or marked as spam, Facebook reduces that application's ability to send more. Applications forcing their users to send spammy invitations can wind up with no invitations at all. The power is in your hands; block applications that are bothering you, and report spammy or abusive communications, and we'll restrict the application.


Good approach. If it works, I might start using Facebook regularly again.

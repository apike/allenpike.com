Last night, WebKit got more interesting: the hardware-accelerated [ CSS 3D Transforms](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-3d-transforms/) spec that is supported on the iPhone came to Leopard. CSS Animations are quite nice to work with on Safari, and this new platform for it enables some [pretty cool effects](http://www.satine.org/archives/2009/07/11/snow-stack-is-here/).

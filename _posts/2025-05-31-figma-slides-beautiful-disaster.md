I think of presentation slides as having 3 main jobs:

- Emphasize key points, so people remember
- Break up complex concepts, so people learn
- Entertain, so people pay attention

This calls for slides that are mostly images or very short phrases. I‚Äôll usually have a couple of slides where I design something a bit more complex to illustrate a point. This sometimes means going back and forth between Keynote and, say, Figma, but it‚Äôs worth the effort.

This year I‚Äôve been building product, and spending a lot more time in Figma. When I was invited to give a talk recently I thought, ‚ÄúWhy not try [Figma Slides](https://www.figma.com/slides/)?‚Äù Figma Slides launched a year back, and [came out of beta in March](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/paigecostello_figma-slides-came-out-of-beta-today-30-activity-7308211241049591811-Z_-U/). I‚Äôve used Keynote for almost 20 years now ‚Äì it seems like time for me to finally adopt a modern presentation tool.

So I gave it a whirl.

Pretty quickly, I appreciated building slides right in Figma. The Grid view made it easy for me to structure my ideas. Features like Auto Layout and Components made building slides that flexed for different kinds of content a snap.

For example, a key point in my talk was that selecting a JavaScript framework can be overwhelming. It was nice to build a quick visual of this right in the deck.

</div>

Designing things in a design tool: actually quite nice.

Admittedly, Figma Slides is missing some Keynote features that I think of as really essential. For example, Keynote has long had an use option to ‚ÄúAutosize Text‚Äù, which will set an object‚Äôs font size to just big enough to fill its container. There‚Äôs no way to do this in Figma‚Äôs auto layout because Figma only wants to support layouts that CSS Grid can implement. That constraint makes sense when designing for the web, but illustrates the tensions inherent in expanding a design tool to other domains.

Another odd omission is that you can‚Äôt create a slide where items (e.g. bullets, sections of a diagram) appear with each click. The closest you can do is to split them into different layers, add a ‚ÄúFade‚Äù animation of 1 millisecond on each, then *reorder the animation order to match the order they‚Äôre displayed on the slide* since it will default to the order the layers were created. I‚Äôm not a fan of bullet-laden decks, but sometimes you just want to make 4 words appear one by one, okay?

Whining aside, building in Figma Slides got me excited. It was powerful, it was fun, and it gave me hope that Figma would successfully make the transition from single-product company about to be acquired by Adobe to multi-product company ready to IPO.

Then I tried to actually give the presentation.

I‚Äôve given enough talks that I know to rehearse a presentation at least once. The conditions must be representative: on an external display, clicker in hand, cued by the presenter display. I know to make sure it works offline, save a backup copy of the deck, and so on. It was during this dry run I noticed some yellow flags:

- You can ‚ÄúSave Local Copy‚Äù of the presentation, but that does not allow you to present without an internet connection ‚Äì that‚Äôs something else.
- Just because you have a presentation open and loaded, does not mean you can present it. If you are offline when you actually click Present, it will barf.
- Once you are presenting, you can click to ‚Äúdownload‚Äù the presentation to be available offline ‚Äì but be careful not to close the tab or it will undownload! If you hit any bugs in Figma after this point, you need to just roll with them.
- When you do click Present, you will not get a full-screen audience view, nor a keyboard shortcut to swap which display is yours and which is for the audience. You will instead get a pop-up window you need to drag over the audience display ‚Äì hope it‚Äôs somewhere intuitive once you plug into the external projector! ‚Äì then maximize it. At a pro event you can do this with the AV crew before they show the audience, but at a meetup this is just visible to the audience.
- Make sure you then move your mouse to the edge of the screen, otherwise it will stay there on top of your slides like it‚Äôs 1999.
- Even beyond this, the functionality around managing Present and the Audience view was just a little‚Ä¶ flaky?

Just an example of the little quirks and features of Figma Slides.

This all made me uneasy, so I practiced the flow more often than usual with an external monitor. I made sure I clicked the right things to make it work offline. Then, I went to go present.

At the venue, I immediatley noticed something odd once the slides were up on their giant 40 foot display: I needed to click twice to advance each slide. Problems at T-minus 60 seconds are unsettling, but I‚Äôm an adult. I can click twice for each slide.

Unfortunately, halfway into my talk I noticed a bigger problem.

The animations ‚Äì which I had used sparingly, only on my most complex slides which needed to be revealed and explained in parts ‚Äì just weren‚Äôt playing. If I clicked (twice) the animation would be triggered internal to Figma, but the audience display would still show a blank slide.

</a>
The exact moment I realize that I‚Äôd been hoisted on my own petard.
</div>

After some exploratory clicking, I discovered that once all the builds on the blank slide had been triggered, it would eventually jump to the next slide. At that point, you could click back to show all the completed animations of the skipped slide. So that‚Äôs what I did: if a slide with 7 builds came up, I would click 14 times to advance through it, and then click back and attempt to explain all seven parts at once.

I stumbled through, and the audience was gracious ‚Äì thankfully it was only 100 people and they were friendly. But it was pretty painful. One silver lining was that the core point of my talk was that you boring technology is underrated, and watching me struggle with Figma Slides helped prove the point. Here lies Allen, murdered by not-boring technology.

While I was able to reproduce the animations bug the next day, I haven‚Äôt been able to since restarting Figma. Their forums have stories of [other](https://forum.figma.com/ask-the-community-7/fixed-figma-slides-show-smart-animate-transition-only-in-presenter-view-and-not-in-audience-view-39081?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [similar](https://forum.figma.com/ask-the-community-7/fixed-figma-slides-show-smart-animate-transition-only-in-presenter-view-and-not-in-audience-view-39081?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [bugs](https://forum.figma.com/ask-the-community-7/figma-slides-with-multiple-videos-in-present-mode-have-to-click-arrow-key-loads-before-next-slide-28477?utm_source=chatgpt.com), none quite the same. So, maybe it‚Äôs fixed.

Even if this specific bug is fixed, though, I get the strong impression that Figma doesn‚Äôt treat presenting Slides as mission-critical. Design decisions like hitting Present offline just causing ‚ÄúError -106‚Äù make it seem like the people in charge of Figma Slides don‚Äôt use it at meetups or conferences. While Keynote is old, and pasting things in from other design tools feels janky, it still benefits from Apple institutionally [giving a shit](https://allenpike.com/2022/giving-a-shit) that giving a presentation to an audience should be bulletproof.

So, in the end, I learned the lesson I was trying to teach. Boring technology is good, actually. 

Here‚Äôs to Keynote: it works, and they give a shit. üçª

Things around the site are going well, despite the fact my work and school have been suboptimal. I'm thinking that working on Faith a bit might help inspire me to get out of my rut. After many years, I'm starting to overcome my hatred of Javascript. Google has proved that Javascript doesn't have to be evil, and I'm starting to see some cool ways I can use it in Engineering Faith.

I got a number of questions about my last post regarding my RSS feed and what the deal with it is. In a nutshell, RSS lets news come to you instead of you having to go look for it. Websites like Altering Time and BBC provide "feed" links that you can give to your newsreader. Then, when those sites are updated, you can read the news without having to visit the site.

**Some popular RSS newsreaders**
- [Mozilla Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/) (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- [SharpReader](http://www.sharpreader.net/) (Windows)
- [Newsfire](http://www.newsfirerss.com/) (Mac)
- [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com/) (Web-based)
- Many others, they're all over the place.

I've found that having my news come into my newsreader rather than checking sites for news myself has saved me a lot of time, so I figured I'd pass that on to you.

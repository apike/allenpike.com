I've been a bit agitated with the iPhone developer program ((The iPod SDK I [asked for two years ago](http://www.antipode.ca/2006/ipod-sdk-open-up/).)). Although I've downloaded the Apple Touch SDK and have gotten a bit beyond "Hello, world!", I can't actually put that still-virtually-useless app on my iPod touch for testing and my own use. Primarily this is because the digital certificates required for this aren't yet available to Canadians. However, according to John Gruber, [none of the 10,000 Americans who have applied have actually been given keys yet](http://daringfireball.net/2008/03/so_whos_in_already). Yes, that's $1,000,000 in application fees. Oh well, at least they're not getting ahead of me.

![An artist's impression of what a fake blogger would look like.](/images/wp-uploads/2009/11/fake_blogger.jpg)Last week I [dreamt of one day inspiring](http://www.antipode.ca/2009/friedisms/) a Fake Allen Pike blog. Hours later, [my dream became reality](http://fakeallenpike.tumblr.com/):


> It’s exciting to see what people will do with access to some of Google’s thick-client Javascript tools.


I was briefly suspicious that the above was copy-pasted from Antipode, but it is actually clever fakery. Not nearly as sarcastic as the Friedisms site was, but still fun. I was unprepared for what struck next - [Fake Fake Allen Pike](http://fakefakeallenpike.tumblr.com/):


> GLARGLE BLARG THICK CLIENTS GLOO BLOOP


Sarcastic, demented, and more or less how my writing looks before I edit it. Meanwhile, [the real Curtis Lassam](http://realcurtislassam.tumblr.com/) discovered he had [an impersonator](http://www.curtis.lassam.net/?p=979) as well:


> I’d accuse him of being the fake, but his site is… well, better at being me than I am. So I suspect that I am likely the fake.


Can anybody discern the identities behind these impostors? It's tough when the fake writers are more convincing when the real ones.

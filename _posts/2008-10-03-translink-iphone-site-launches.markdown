Translink and my friends at [Handi Mobility have taken the wraps off](http://blog.handimobility.ca/2008/10/03/translink-iphone/) of a new [iPhone-optimized Translink site](http://m.translink.ca/). Check it out if you have an iPhone (or other mobile WebKit browser) and use transit in Vancouver. It looks good and feels good! Now all I need is the Maps application on the iPhone to give me trip plans, and my life will be complete. ((There is a [mobile Google Transit website](http://maps.google.com/transit?output=mobile), but it doesn't work in Vancouver. It "appears to be outside our current coverage area", even though the desktop version works fine. Grr.))

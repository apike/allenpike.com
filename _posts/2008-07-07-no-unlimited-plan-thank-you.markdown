There's been [a](http://www.brendonwilson.com/blog/2008/06/27/rogers-iphone-3g-pricing-lube-not-included/) [lot](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/06/27/rogers-canada) [of](http://johnbiehler.com/2008/07/04/is-rogers-getting-the-message/) [uproar](http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2008/07/06/iphone-pricing-in-canada-rogers-american-pr-firm-ms-l-digital-sends-bloggers-ide) about the Canadian iPhone plans from Rogers. There are some legitimate complaints: the three year contracts, the 150 minutes for $80 "value" plan, and the overpricing of data.

One thing that I don't think is a legitimate request is people's demand for unlimited data. There's no such thing as unlimited plans, there's only plans where you don't know what the limit is. A year ago, I posted a (somewhat silly) [rant about the unlimited iPhone plans](http://www.antipode.ca/2007/death-to-unlimited/), which I still stand by.

"Unlimited" sucks. Demand reasonable bandwidth caps or cheap per-gigabyte rates.

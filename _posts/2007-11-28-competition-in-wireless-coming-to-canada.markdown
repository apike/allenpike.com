Industry Canada has announced that [they are opening the door for more wireless competition](http://techvibesblog.com/wireless-competition-for-the-big-3/). In May they will be auctioning off a chunk of wireless spectrum, with 40% only available to upstart wireless carriers. That is, Rogers, Bell, and Telus will not be allowed to bid for that portion. In addition, they will be mandating that wireless carriers must share their tower infrastructure for reasonable rates. Together, this means we will be seeing (at least) a new wireless carrier in Canada in the near future. It may be wishful thinking, but I imagine we'll see a new GSM provider with data rates that blow Telus and friends out of the water. Maybe then data won't be [20x more expensive in Canada than it is in Rwanda](http://www.thomaspurves.com/2007/04/09/canada-worse-than-3rd-world-countries-when-it-comes-to-mobile-data-access/).

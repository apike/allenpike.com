[iPhone voice and data packages for Canada are now live](http://www.rogers.com/web/content/wireless-products/iphone_voice_data_packages). You can get voice and data starting at $60, which is better than I expected. Although you only get 150 daytime minutes and 400MB with that plan, it's a big improvement for Canadian data rates.

[Miss604 notes](http://www.miss604.com/2007/10/odds-ends-and-apple-store-in-vancouver.html) that an official Apple Store [is finally coming to Vancouver](http://www.ifoapplestore.com/db/2007/10/17/vancouver-site-finally-confirmed/), but not for a while:


> ... construction will begin in 2009 for retail space where Apple will locate its first western Canada store. That work will be finished by the holiday season of 2009 and, most importantly, for the 2010 Olympic Games that begin in February.


The resellers are okay, but they usually don't have products on the day of release, and don't have the famed Genius Bar.

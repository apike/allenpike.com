On [the most recent episode of The Talk Show](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2024/12/02/ep-415), “A Good Duck Butt”, John Gruber and I discussed Apple Intelligence, Pixelmator, ChatGPT and Siri, the latest LLMs, and cursed faces.

Two developments since we recorded:

1. iOS 18.2 was released, which added image generation and web search to Siri's ChatGPT integration.
2. Llama 3.3 70B was released, [a new high-water mark for local models](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/9/llama-33-70b/) – if you have 64GB of memory.

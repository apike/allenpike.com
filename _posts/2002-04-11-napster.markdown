![What Napster means is about as obvious as why people still use it.](/images/old/napster.gif) FRANKFURT, GERMANY - On Friday, the CEO of the giant German media company       Bertelsmann announced they were prepared to purchase Napster, the file-swapping       program that started the File Sharing Revolution. Up to $30 million is earmarked       for the purchase, which equates out to $15 million spent on each person       who still uses Napster. While this deal sounds odd to some users, it was       expected in the industry. "Bertelsmann has been interested in Napster since       before the lawsuit," said Thomas Middelhoff, CEO of Bertelsmann.

John Fanning, uncle of the creator of   Napster and owner of much of the company, has been using Napster since Beta   2. "The selection went down when they blocked every song known to man, and a   little bit more when everyone else left the service, but there's a lovely young   lady I chat with on there sometimes, and we exchange classical music," he said   in an interview.

Steve Erickson, a 54-year old inmate   at Delaware State Penitentiary, is the other user of the service. "What do you   mean why do I still use Napster? There's alternatives? What the *edited*! This   is bull*edited*! You mean I could be getting chat _and_ copyrighted music   for free all this *edited* time?! *edited*" According to research there are   no females who use the service.

The writer of this article owns one   share in Napster, which he is using as a fund to give $9999 to everyone who   forwards an untraceable email he sent out.

I've always [hated modal interruptions](http://www.antipode.ca/tag/modal-dialogs/), and Chrome has done what should have been done ages ago: [made them modal per tab rather than per window](http://blog.chromium.org/2009/12/tab-modality-and-you.html). Apparently this is [quite tricky in Cocoa](http://googlemac.blogspot.com/2009/12/cocoa-and-tab-modality.html), but I'm glad they bothered to make it happen. Death to modal interruptions!

Due to popular demand, a full 3D mode has been added to the Engineering Faith plan. The web-based, text-based gameplay will remain the same, but will be augmented with a 3-dimensional view of all the people in your faith. You'll be able to watch them dance, pray, convert, and even reproduce new followers. Also due to popular demand, Faith will be supporting all versions of Internet Explorer from 2 to 6. While working around IE 6's bugs is a tough challenge, I thought, why just go half the way.

On an somewhat related note, I think I've pinned down the release date for public beta as late spring, 2009. While that might be over-ambitious, I want to set an aggressive schedule to keep myself on my toes. If all goes well, I'll finish Faith before the internet is replaced with something better!

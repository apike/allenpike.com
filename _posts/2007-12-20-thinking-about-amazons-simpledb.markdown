Ryan Barrett is [sharing his thoughts on Amazon's new hosted database service](http://snarfed.org/space/amazon+simpledb+thoughts): ((Via [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/december#thu-20-thoughts).))

> Sure, it's limited. It includes design decisions that clearly simplified the implementation at the cost of functionality and usability. Still, as a result of those decisions, SimpleDB has the potential to be very robust, scalable, and performant.       

We're considering implementing our next product at work with Amazon's new hosted services, including SimpleDB. Their S3 storage seems like a no-brainer, and their EC2 virtual server service seems very useful. As somebody who thinks in relational terms, though, I'm still skeptical of such a simple data store.

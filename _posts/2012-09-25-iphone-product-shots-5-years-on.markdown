Five years ago, Apple PR released high-quality photos of the newly-announced iPhone. These shots prominently featured the home screen. After five years of subtle improvements, it's hard to say what's more striking: the total change, or how much has stayed the same?

### **The more things change...**


The sum of many small changes has a really big impact. The Retina change doesn't really show in the product shots, but many design changes and post-production decisions do.



	
  * Naturally, the 16:9 screen is the most dramatic change.

	
  * Believe it or not, the original iPhone promo shots didn't have the now-trademark reflective sheen on them.

	
  * There are seven new icons: Videos, Passbook, Reminders, Newsstand, iTunes, App Store, and Game Center. In retrospect, the empty row for icons on an iPhone with no App Store should have been suspicious.

	
  * The cellular provider is no longer shown in the promo shots, even though it shows full cellular signal. I'm not sure if this configuration is actually possible.

	
  * Calculator goes away, although nothing else does.

	
  * iPod has become Music, Text has become Messages. Next up: Phone becomes Voice?




### Boring


Despite these changes, it's really remarkable how much is the same, five iterations later. [How positively boring](http://curiousrat.com/home/2012/9/17/boring.html).



	
  * Every visible button is still in the same location: home, power, volume, mute.

	
  * The first and last rows of icons are exactly the same! The same eight apps are in the same eight places in iOS 6 as in iPhone OS 1.

	
  * The icons have kept their exact shape and spacing. What originally seemed distinctive is now an industry standard.

	
  * It's still 9:41, even though the Clock app has changed to a more traditional 10:15.

	
  * The dock still remains four apps anchored to the bottom of the screen. It's worth remembering that on the original iPhone the dock wasn't really even a dock, since you only had one screen and couldn't rearrange icons.

	
  * The calendar's day is the weekday and date of that device's announcement. Thoughtful consistency though subtle change.




### Boring or revolutionary?


Considering how far the functionality has come in these five years, it's kind of bizarre how little the basic promo shots have changed. The hardware is a little taller, but it's still fundamentally a refinement. The iPhone team has fed us a steady drip of pleasant refinements that add up to something not revolutionary, but a hell of a lot better than what we had in 2007. Even if it is still 9:41.

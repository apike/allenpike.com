Apparently the [courts in New York agree with me](http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/20981) that [unlimited plans](http://www.antipode.ca/2007/death-to-unlimited/) should either be actually unlimited, or not be called that.


> New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo announced yesterday that his office had beaten a $1 million "agreement" out of Verizon Wireless that will see the carrier compensate 13,000 customers it had summarily disconnected from their "unlimited" plans because they had taken the word to mean what it means.


Meanwhile, the iPhone data plan in France [is "unlimited*", where * means 200MB per month](http://www.iphoneatlas.com/2007/10/18/o2-unlimited-iphone-data-plan-not-so-unlimited/). Why not just call it 200MB?

Last month, I started full-time on [a new startup](https://forestwalk.ai/). Itâ€™s early days, but weâ€™re having a lot of fun.

A startup, fundamentally, is a search for a repeatable, scalable business model. You rapidly try things, run experiments, learn, and iterate your theories about how to build a useful product that people love.

This experimental nature makes many founders reluctant to talk about their startups early on. _What if I share our initial ideas, but they turn out to be wrong?_ It can seem nothing is certain enough to talk about.

For [Jenn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jncoops/) and me, though, a few things _do_ seem certain:

1. We want to build software that people love
2. This software needs to be valuable enough that it can support an incredible team
3. LLMs have created a horde of opportunities to build great, useful products
4. Sharing what weâ€™re learning is worthwhile

That makes for a great initial sketch of where to direct our work.

# Getting started

A delightful part about learning new things is that knowledge has a fractal shape. Recently, we started with a high-level curiosity:

> How do you build great products on LLMs?

Researching this uncovered many deeper problems and questions, for example:

> How do you test and evaluate a non-deterministic LLM-powered product as your team iterates?

Inside this lay countless finer-grained questions around evaluation approaches, workflows, safety, developer experience, testing, product experiment velocity, and so on.

In more-established domains, researching fractally into a problem uncovers layers of increasingly detailed answers and best practices. When youâ€™re researching an emerging area, though, once you get more than one or two questions deep â€“ even talking to world experts â€“ you hit on meaningful unsolved problems.

In the interviews Iâ€™ve been doing, I often get answers like,

> Oh, I donâ€™t know! I would love to hear what other teams are doing for that.

or

> I saw a paper on that, but I donâ€™t know of anybody who has tried implementing it.

or

> If you can solve that well, can we be your first customer?

Those are exciting things to hear!

So weâ€™re spending our days writing code, learning, and talking to engineering teams who are building with LLMs. Worst case, we learn a lot about how to apply a useful new tool, and help some folks along the way. Ideal case, the product weâ€™re prototyping helps those teams ship awesome products faster, kickstarting a great business.

If youâ€™re a developer who wants to try what weâ€™re working on when itâ€™s ready, or compare notes on the challenges of applying LLMs on product teams, [get in touch](https://om5mj4keoar.typeform.com/to/m9VicSt2?typeform-source=forestwalk.ai)!

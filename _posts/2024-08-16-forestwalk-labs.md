Last month, I started full-time on [a new startup](https://forestwalk.ai/). It’s early days, but we’re having a lot of fun.

A startup, fundamentally, is a search for a repeatable, scalable business model. You rapidly try things, run experiments, learn, and iterate your theories about how to build a useful product that people love.

This experimental nature makes many founders reluctant to talk about their startups early on. *What if I share our initial ideas, but they turn out to be wrong?* It can seem nothing is certain enough to talk about.

For [Jenn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jncoops/) and I, though, a few things *do* seem certain:

1. We want to build software that people love
2. This software needs to be valuable enough that it can support an incredible team
3. LLMs have created a horde of opportunities to build great, useful products
4. Sharing what we’re learning is worthwhile

That makes a great initial sketch of where to direct our work.

# A starting point

A delightful thing about learning new things is that, generally, they have a fractal shape. Recently, we started with a high-level curiosity:

> How do you build great products on LLMs?

Researching this raised many problems and questions, for example:

> How do you test and evaluate a non-deterministic LLM-powered product as you iterate and improve it?

From this popped countless finer-grained questions around evaluation approaches, workflows, developer experience, the various hats folks on product teams wear, and so on.

In more-established domains, researching deep into a problem like this leads to a series of more detailed answers. When it comes to building products on top of LLMs, though, once you get more than one or two questions deep, even talking to world experts, you hit on meaningfully unsolved problems.

In the interviews I’ve been doing, I often get answers like, “Oh, I don’t know! I would love to hear what other teams are doing for that,” or “I saw a paper that but I don’t know of anybody who has tried implementing it,” or “If you can solve that well, we should be your first customer.”

Those are exciting things to hear!

So we’re spending our days prototyping, and experimenting, and talking to engineering teams who are building with LLMs. Worst case, we learn a lot about how to apply a fascinating new tool. Ideal case, the product we’re prototyping helps those teams ship awesome products faster.

If you’re a developer who wants to try what we’re working on when it’s ready, or compare notes on the world of LLM product development, [get in touch](https://om5mj4keoar.typeform.com/to/m9VicSt2?typeform-source=forestwalk.ai)!

Or, you can just follow along as I write about the wild adenture of starting something new. 🚀

Dan Cederholm's [post recently on dropping IE6 support](http://www.simplebits.com/notebook/2009/02/13/iegone.html) made me think. [Some sites](http://idroppedie6.com/) try to catalogue every site that drops IE6, but how useful is that? If you're trying to convince a boss or client that dropping IE6 is precedented, they don't care if Allen Pike or even the esteemed Dan Cederholm have done it. And so, I try to keep tabs on what big players have dropped IE6 support. Currently, my tally stands at: [37Signals](http://37signals.blogs.com/products/2008/07/basecamp-phasin.html), MobileMe, iWork.com, and GMail. Am I missing anyone else?

Snook had [an excellent idea](http://twitter.com/snookca/status/1230083124) this morning: implementing IE's non-standard [page transitions](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms673540(VS.85).aspx) for users who've chosen that noble browser. This way Firefox users will know what they're missing out on!

37signals [says what I've been complaining about for years](http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1151-why-are-modern-sneakers-so-ugly):


> So comfortable inside, why so ugly outside? Unfortunately, few of the other choices were much better. Apparently sneakers must be FUTURISTIC and have 593 different elements in order to prove they were DESIGNED.


OMG YES. Last time I bought sneakers I spent hours trying to find a simple-looking pair that was comfortable, and this time around I'm not sure if I'll have the stamina.

In a decision initially assumed to be an April Fool's joke, Google has announced 
  GMail, a free email service that offers one gigabyte, or 1000MB, of email storage 
  per user. However, now that the New York Times and and Associated Press are 
  running stories about it, complete with quotes from Google staff, amusement 
  is giving way to shock. GMail's two main competitors, Hotmail and Yahoo Mail, 
  offer 2MB and 4MB of storage respectively.




"It is completely unfeasible for Google to offer 1000MB of storage space," 
  said one source for Microsoft's Hotmail unit. When told that GMail would indeed 
  offer 500 times the storage of Hotmail, he countered that, "obviously there 
  would be loads of banner ads." When it was pointed out that Google has 
  no intention of doing banner ads, but simply text ads, we were asked, "How 
  do I sign up?"




While Yahoo Mail prepares to switch their marketing pitch from "Twice 
  the storage space of our biggest competitor" to "1/250th of the storage 
  space of our biggest competitor" the question on everybody's mind is, "how 
  the heck can Google **do** that?" We asked a panel of analysts 
  to give their opinions. "Google is actually powered by God," argued 
  on analyst. While Google has neither admitted this nor denied that claim, that 
  would explain their ability to turn a huge profit while providing awesome services 
  for completely free. Another analyst insisted, "They actually use 1GB of 
  your own computer's space without you knowing it."




Other analysts' theories include lying about how much space you're using, that 
  1GB is a typo for 1MB, and that there is no such thing as email. One of our 
  analysts in particular was insistent that GMail will fail. "GMail rhymes 
  with email," warned the analyst. "New users will get confused, and 
  not be able to tell the difference. Chaos will ensue." While none of these 
  have been substantiated, analysts are generally always correct.




One analyst mentioned, "In unrelated news, Google has won a multi-billion 
  contract with the Department of Homeland Security for an 'Information Storage 
  and Retreival System' for national security and awareness purposes." While 
  we're not sure what the analyst was getting at there, we're sure the US Government 
  wouldn't be interested at all in tracking millions of gigabytes (also known 
  as petabytes) of communication.




Our own research indicates that Google may actually be able to provide this 
  service, as long as they do the following things: track you intesively and sell 
  the information, charge govrnments an arm and a leg to do the same, prohibit 
  emails to and from Hotmail once the service is popular, and pray nobody uses 
  their entire gigabyte of space.




The author of this article really likes Google, but is less of a fan of the 
  FBI being alerted if he uses the word "bomb" in an email.

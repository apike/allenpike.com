![](/images/wp-uploads/2008/07/second_year.jpg)After my first year of this blog format, I [set out some goals for this second year](http://www.antipode.ca/2007/one-year-of-altering-log/). Tonight I ran some statistics and it turns out I accomplished my goals. This year I posted at twice the frequency, three times the consistency, ((Specifically, reducing the standard deviation of my post frequency from 22 days to 7. Yes, 22 is a ridiculous deviation for a weekly blog.)) and with half the longest gap between posts. Additionally, I chose a name that doesn't suck.

Since publicly making goals worked so well last year, I'll set some goals here for the coming year. In the short term, I'm going to write more [articles](http://www.antipode.ca/2008/your-browsers-command-line/), rather than just one-paragraph links. I like the links, but they're an easy out. In the medium term, I'm going to do more sharing of [things I learn](http://www.antipode.ca/2008/ie-wants-to-know-your-background/). Over the year, I'm going to keep an eye out for long gaps between posts, and try not to fall off the wagon. ((My worst was 118 days between posts in my first year and 48 this year.))

Onward!

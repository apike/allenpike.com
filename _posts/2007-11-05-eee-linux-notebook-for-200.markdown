Great reviews are coming in for Asus' "Eee", a tiny (less than one kg) Linux notebook that is selling between $200 and $400, depending on the configuration. [Ars Technica points out that this is a big deal](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20071105-game-changer-asus-eee-pc-a-win-for-intel-and-linux-at-microsofts-expense.html):


> The device does support Windows XP, but Linux seems to be the OS of choice for all of the reviewers for performance and ease-of-use reasons. In this respect, Microsoft has well and truly blown it, because this device is poised to introduce a few million Best Buy shoppers to a pleasantly usable, non-embedded Linux distro.


It's a lot like the [One Laptop Per Child](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLPC) machine, but for sale at Best Buy. I'd get my kids one of these, if I had kids.

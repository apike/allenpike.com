Now it gets serious.

Altering Time's yearly makeover is done, and Engineering Faith is, as expected, the focus of 2005. "Faithful Engineering" has been launched, a full-fledged weblog to track the development progress. You can now expect fairly regular updates, which can be monitored through any RSS newsreader from my new [news feed](feed:http://www.alteringtime.com/faith/wp-rss2.php).

I will write here about progress, insights, and new ideas that go into the game. While I will continue to post in the Forum about it where appropriate, I will try to keep any new info here for everybody to see.

At the moment, I'm aiming for testing to begin by the end of the year. There's no reason that can't be accomplished - I've learned a lot in the last two years about web development and games, and I'm enjoying putting it to use.

Now back to coding!

  REDMOND, WA, USA - Microsoft's .NET Passport login system that they 
  use for Hotmail and other services has been hit by yet another security 
  scandal, one that could cost them $2.2 trillion dollars. A very easy 
  to exploit flaw in their password recovery allowed anybody in the world 
  to access anybody's Passport (and hence Hotmail) just by knowing their 
  login.The Federal Trade Commission asserted last year that future breaches 
  of security that jeapordize users' information could face fines of $11 
  000 per infraction, which would, considering 200 million accounts, add 
  to $2,200,000,000,000.




For the last year, the only thing 
  one needed to do to hijack a Hotmail account was type "emailpwdreset" 
  and your own email address into the right place of a web address, and 
  voilia, you get an email with a new password. While this had been in 
  existance since sometime in 2002, emails of "My account's been 
  hijacked!" to MSN Support were just being responded to with what 
  amounted to, "Don't give out your password then. Go away." 
  Although Microsoft had been contacted about this security flaw by email, 
  it wasn't until it was posted publicly to a security mailing list that 
  they closed the hole (three hours later.)




It seems users are now starting to 
  understand Microsoft's new "Trustworthy Computing" theme. 
  "I really trust Microsoft," said one system administrator. 
  "As long as I check every few hours for security patches, my systems 
  are only vulnerable to publicly known attacks for a few hours every 
  week or two." Hotmail users in general are warming up to Microsoft 
  due to this news. "Oh, they fixed another hole that could allow 
  anyone to take over my account?" asked one Hotmail user. "Well 
  aren't they great? Always working hard to make my life better."




Security experts leaped to Microsoft's 
  defense. "They're great! Keep buying their products," urged 
  one expert who specializes in disaster recovery. Another expert, an 
  aftermarket security software developer, agreed. "Microsoft is 
  the most trustworthy email provider I can think of that is supported 
  by ads and spam, and rhymes with Lycrosoft." We asked one of our 
  security experts to email us a list of all the reasons why Microsoft 
  systems and services are secure and trustworthy, but unfortunately each 
  time we asked, we only received blank emails.




This whole issue brings up the question: 
  what IS a Microsoft Passport? Microsoft wants it to be where you keep 
  all your credit card and personal information, allowing you to easily 
  authorize them to charge things with the minimal of fuss. In reality, 
  it's their login system for MSN Messenger and Hotmail. Passports' login 
  is an email address, and that's one's login for MSN Messenger. (It's 
  actually possible to register an @alteringtime.com email as a Passport 
  for Messenger use, allowing you to be totally Hotmail-free.)




The author of this article doesn't 
  use much Microsoft software, but has more free time and money to waste 
  now so he begins to wish he did.

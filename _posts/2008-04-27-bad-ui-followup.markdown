In the last week I posted a couple rants about bad UI, one about dialogs with stupid options, another about games that won't just let you exit. Steve responds with a [great example of crappy dialog button text](http://tewha.net/2008/04/yesno/), and PC Gamer has an [even harder time getting out of Assassin's Creed](http://www.pcgamer.com/archives/2008/04/41008_-_assassi.html) than I did getting out of Rock Band.

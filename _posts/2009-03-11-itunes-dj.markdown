[Macworld](http://www.macworld.com/article/139330/2009/03/itunes.html), via [Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/03/11/itunes-81), brought to my attention something wonderful about iTunes 8.1:


> With iTunes DJ, iPhone users that have Apple’s Remote application installed can request songs to be played. Users can also vote to control when songs are played.


I will never again have to worry about somebody taking the iTunes computer and cutting from the party playlist to Soulja Boy on infinite repeat.

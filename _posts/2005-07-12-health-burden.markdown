I've been pretty sick the last few days, which has conspired against me. Just as I was getting sick, I pulled apart the Places of Worship page, and realized the whole thing needs to be more complex than I'd thought.

It turns out that the idea of figuring out how many followers will visit a place of worship in a given time period isn't simple! I have to take into account the place's location, capacity, awesomeness, number of followers, community level of followers, and age of the place.

This isn't very hard, except for one extra variable - how do other places of worship affect each others' attendance? When I realized my calculations didn't take that into account, I realized programming whilst sick really is a bad idea. Anyway, I'm working on a simpler design for the system that'll take all that into account, **and** be understandable to players! Hopefully it'll be reassembled by the end of the week.

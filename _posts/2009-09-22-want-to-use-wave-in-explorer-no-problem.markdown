Google Wave is a really ambitious HTML5 app that would be virtually impossible to get running correctly in IE. Rather than telling Explorer users to go download and install another browser, which sounds like a huge pain, they tell people to just [click here and get a plugin](http://googlewavedev.blogspot.com/2009/09/google-wave-in-internet-explorer.html). That plugin, of course, is Google Chrome's entire rendering engine. These people are my heroes.

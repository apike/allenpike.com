![Budgetable](/images/wp-uploads/2006/11/budgetable_square.jpg)I've been mentioning Budgetable, but haven't properly explained what the farmer it is. Budgetable is a [web-based personal finance tracker](http://www.budgetable.com/) that I'm writing, and is currently in alpha testing. It currently tracks your spending and income, displays basic graphs, and acts as a little window into your financial situation.

Right now it imports from my bank only, (you use [Aldergrove Credit Union](http://www.aldergrovecu.ca/) of British Columbia right?) but Version 1 will have a general import that _should_ handle downloads from banks around the world, or at least North America. Of course at first I won't have tested every bank in the world, but that would be your guys' job. You can also expect a slick manual entry feature, and the ability to categorize your expenses to see where your money is going.

My initial reason to write it was because I was wondering where the heck my money keeps wandering off to (turns out I drink a lot of coffee). My second reason is that my competition looks pretty lame, compared to how many people seem interested in using such a service. I have a legion (well, 5) twenty-something internet-types chomping at the bit to start using it, and I plan to get it ready for them before they chomp through the bit and injure me.

As with everything else, work on Budgetable comes (ideally) after school and work, but since I myself use it, there's a good chance it'll see improvements. Stay tuned for more info as the project comes along (likely there'll be a lot of progress once finals are over). In any case, I'm sure it'll be highly unprofitable.

I’ve spent the last year trying to decide if Steamclock should go all-remote, or if we’re better off going back to all-in-office. Both options have substantial upsides! And both avoid the dreaded “hybrid” meetings with half the team in a conference room and half on Zoom.

I feel a bit silly that, after all this time, [we’ve decided to do neither](https://steamclock.com/blog/2021/04/remote-hiring/). For us, neither extreme is going to build us the best team, and lead to the best software.

Still, I think our approach for avoiding hybrid meetings – namely, cutting down meetings – will be great. And “Vancouver HQ or Remote” feels like the right heading on our job ads.

So if you’re one of the many thoughtful, skilled developers doing quality work in many of Canada's beautiful out-of-the-way places, I’d love to chat! [Especially if you make apps.](https://steamclock.com/careers/lead-ios-mobile-developer) But even if you don’t – yet.

The Firefox guys are working on a new project called Electrolysis forÂ [separating Firefox into multiple processes](http://benjamin.smedbergs.us/blog/2009-06-16/electrolysis-making-mozilla-faster-and-more-stable-using-multiple-processes/), like Chrome. This has been my #1 feature request for Firefox for quite some time, and now they've [got their proof of concept running](http://blog.mozilla.com/cjones/2009/06/21/multi-process-firefox-coming-to-an-internets-near-you/). Considering the size and age of the Gecko code, though, I won't be holding my breath quite yet.

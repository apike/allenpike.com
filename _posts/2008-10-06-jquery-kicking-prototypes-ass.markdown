![](/images/wp-uploads/2008/10/jquery.jpg) A [lot](http://warpedvisions.org/) [of](http://livingcode.org/) [people](http://snook.ca/jonathan/) are very excited about jQuery. I hear a lot of, "jQuery has concise code, jQuery has less iteration, jQuery has a rock star on their website. A rock star!" I've always been kind of skeptical, though, since a few of the things people love about jQuery are actually in Prototype now, such as the ability to directly manipulate and chain some uses of `$()`, as well as the `$$()` function for returning items based on arbitrary CSS selectors.

With all these people talking about how sweet JQuery is, though, I wondered if it was on track to replace Prototype as the #1 JS framework. Well, [according to Google Trends](http://www.google.com/trends?q=prototype%2C+jquery), interest in JQuery is blowing away interest in Prototype. What's more notable is that these numbers _include other uses of the word "prototype"!_ Very impressive. Next time I have a choice of JS frameworks, I'll give it a run for its money.

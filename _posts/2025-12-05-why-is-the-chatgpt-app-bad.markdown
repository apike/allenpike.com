Last week [I wrote an exploration](https://allenpike.com/2025/why-is-chatgpt-so-good-claude) of Ben Thompson's recent question, "Why is the ChatGPT Mac app so good?" A lot of people on the internet, it turns out, do not agree with this premise!

Many folks have been having problems with ⌘C not copying text. Hacker News [sees the app as](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46105896) "not good at all", to the point that my post about it being better than the alternatives was flagged off the site. [X doesn't like it either](https://x.com/rjonesy/status/1997030661513973809?s=20).

Beyond the bugs I mentioned in last week's post, I've recently been plagued with a ChatGPT Mac bug of my own, where every time I start a new chat, it will pre-fill the text field with the first input I used last time I started a new chat on Mac.

All of this led me to [an informative post](https://x.com/stephancasas/status/1983717553559236852) by one of OpenAI’s Mac developers, Stephan Casas:

> nearly everyone who works on the ChatGPT macOS app has been stretched thin, and hard at work building Atlas.
>
> [...]
>
> i’m thankful that our users appreciate our decision to develop a native app just as much as i’m thankful for the heightened expectations they hold because we did so

Apparently he [merged a fix this week](https://x.com/stephancasas/status/1995982841889566996) for the copy-paste bug that has been plaguing many folks, which is promising.

Something implied in last week's article that's worth saying explicitly: although many good Mac apps are native, **being native is neither necessary nor sufficient for being a great app**.

While OpenAI is investing more in desktop apps than any other model labs, they have work to do before they can transcend "better than the alternatives" and achieve "great."

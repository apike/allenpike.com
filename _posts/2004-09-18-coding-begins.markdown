Things are coming along, slowly but surely. Coding started in the last couple weeks, and some basic sections have begun. There's some tables in the database, and some basic code that manages multiple games and pages. Still hoping for a basic game framework (not at the this-is-fun stage, but at the create-use-finish kind of stage) in winter.

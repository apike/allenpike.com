After an eternity of first waiting on phpBB, then waiting on myself, our Forums have been upgraded to phpBB3. This means goodbye spam and goodbye bugs! As this expected, this broke a lot of nifty integrations I'd done between this blog, the site, and the forum, which I've been recoding. There's plenty left to be done, but even in its backward state, I think it's an improvement nonetheless.

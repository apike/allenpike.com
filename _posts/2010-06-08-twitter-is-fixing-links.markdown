Last year I [complained about URL shorteners on Twitter](http://www.antipode.ca/2009/twitter-and-url-mangling/), and proposed a solution. Today they announced that they're [adopting something similar](http://blog.twitter.com/2010/06/links-and-twitter-length-shouldnt.html):



> All links shared on Twitter.com or third-party apps will be wrapped with a t.co URL. A really long link such as _http://www.amazon.com/Delivering-Happiness-Profits-Passion-Purpose/dp/0446563048_ might be wrapped as _http://t.co/DRo0trj_ for display on SMS, but it could be displayed to web or application users as _amazon.com/Delivering-_ or as the whole URL or page title.



My guess is that Twitter clients will just use the domain as the link text, but either way it's a big win for usability and readability. Any suggestions on what domains I should punish on Unladen Follow?

TOKYO, JAPAN - Recently released figures say Microsoft's debut into           the game system world isn't very successful in Japan. About 1/7 of as           many systems have been sold in Japan as America, although Japan has           always been a great market for video game consoles. "I wish I lived           in Japan," commented one software developer.




Microsoft has noted it could           blame many factors, such as economic conditions, language bias, or email           spammers. Japanese Nintendo and Sony fans are mostly afraid of getting           the famed Blue Screen Of Death while playing their favourite game. While           Altering Time's own research with developers has found that all three           video game systems are almost equally easy to develop for, some developers           don't feel morally right helping out a company who reportedly owns 75%           shares in Evil. "There's a big market in Evil these days," a Microsoft           spokeswoman was quick to defend. "I think we've proven that time and           again."




Another reason for this is a           lack of established characters. While Nintendo has powerhouses like           Mario and the Pokï¿½mon gang, and Sony has the Final Fantasy series among           others, Microsoft has rights to Billy G, The Digital Monopolist. While           Microsoft is confident in it's new game, SimAntiTrust, some gamers are           sceptical."I think Princess Peach is hotter than Bill Gates," commented           one gamer.




The writer of this article also           finds Princess Peach to be hotter than Bill Gates.

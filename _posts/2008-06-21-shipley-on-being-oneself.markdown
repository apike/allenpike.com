Wil Shipley [said something](http://wilshipley.com/blog/2008/06/delicious-library-2-has-shipped.html) in his post about finally shipping Delicious Library 2 that struck me:


> I'm officially renouncing my phony pimpitude. Honestly, I'm just a geek who stays up late and plays GTA and makes clumsy passes at pretty girls and tries to write software. That's me.


When I met Wil at WWDC, I found myself conflicted about whether his "I'm an awesome indie developer who drives a Lotus so there" attitude was a necessary consequence of being awesome. He's kindly resolved my conflict.

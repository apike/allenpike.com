[HavenWorks.com](http://havenworks.com/) gets my nomination for the worst-designed website ever.Â  It's a simultaneous travesty of graphic design, information design, and code design. Of the three, the information design is clearly the worst - Edward Tufte would shit a brick if he saw this. The page's 4MB of HTML code is pretty impressive too - [12,000 errors, according to the w3c validator](http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fhavenworks.com%2F). Even though the site seems like it took a ridiculous amount of work to make, I think it probably took the same amount of time a normal medium-sized website takes, except none of that time was spent removing or simplifying things.

For those who don't know, the One Laptop Per Child project's goal was to get an open Linux laptop into the hands of every child in developing countries for $100 per child. It seems the [alternative goal of getting a Windows laptop](http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/mar2008/tc2008035_429837.htm) into the hands of some children in developing countries and some adults in rich countries for $200 each was more realistic. Having tried to develop for the Linux software stack for these machines, I'll say that although I'm not too surprised, I'm still disappointed.

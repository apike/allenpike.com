![A glimpse of Google Analytics.](/images/wp-uploads/2007/05/analytics.jpg)[Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) last week overhauled their UI to go from mediocrily bad to quite good. What do they have to say about AlteringTime.com? Here's an analysis of their analysis.


### The Traffic





	
  * Asylum is still the most popular thing on the site.

	
  * Faith is now second place!

	
  * Not a whole lot of people use the main front page (4% of hits)

	
  * The Ballad of Bilbo Baggins and Stick Fight files that I host got well over 1,000 hits a month, making them each slightly more popular than WTF Sites and the Quotes.

	
  * About 30 people a month read my [resume](http://www.alteringtime.com/allen/resume.php) - wtf?

	
  * My [call for an iPod SDK](http://www.alteringtime.com/log/archives/96) is the most popular blog post at more than 100 hits a month, after which is my last status post on Faith (wow, obviously I need to make another one), and then my post on [Google Image Labeler](http://www.alteringtime.com/log/archives/88).




### What most people were looking for


7 of the top 10 search keywords are either for one of those reposted media files like Bilbo Baggins or stick fight. The top 10 searches for content I actually made are:



	
  * **altering time** - I bet this is just people using Firefox's "I'm Feeling Lucky" address bar feature..

	
  * **ipod sdk** - I'm one of the top authorities on this.

	
  * **altering time blog** - Sounds lame to me.

	
  * **political asylum **- When I was the top hit for this I'd sometimes get weird emails actually asking for political asylum and feel bad!

	
  * **altering log** - Less searches than "altering time blog"... should I rename this thing?

	
  * **alteringtime.com** - Seriously?

	
  * **budgetable** - Wow!

	
  * **allen pike** - Did you know that a different Allen Pike designed the Batmobile?

	
  * **engineering faith** - People want it.

	
  * **wet floor signs** - lol

	
  * **free political game** - Exactly what we offer.




### What weird people were looking for


I couldn't look through all of the thousands of things people searched for to find AT, but here are some of the interesting ones I noticed.



	
  * **facebook porn** - wtf, why?

	
  * **famous topics** - We're the top hit!

	
  * **create your own religion** - a lot of people want to do this it seems!

	
  * **second person story** - how can I be the third site for this after Wikipedia and MIT?

	
  * **cybersex logs** - I doubt they'll get what they were looking for on AT...

	
  * **_allan_ pike** - Holy crap, I'm the #2 hit for this! Thanks Google!

	
  * **indecent exposure pics** - They must have dug deep in the search results to find AT.

	
  * **quotes about rocks** - Google confused this with _quotes that rock_.

	
  * **serious news articles** - Google doesn't understand sarcasm.

	
  * **swallow a frisbee** - Do they want instructions, or..?

	
  * **singapore swinger ad posting **- I don't _think_ we have these?

	
  * **altering clothes** - You're going to be disappointed man.

	
  * **popped cherry** - Really?

	
  * **ninjas riding hippos** - Classic.

	
  * **boring things** - Step right up and get your boring things!

	
  * **oldguy sex **- Augh!

	
  * **allen pike is sexy** - Very funny guys.

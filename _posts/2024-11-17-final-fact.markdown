After 82 episodes, the Fun Fact podcast has reached [Final Fact](https://funfact.fm/episodes/82) – at least, for now. Good things don’t always get a satisfying ending, but this one turned out.

Fans of the show may enjoy [It Shipped That Way](https://www.itshipped.fm/), where I've been interviewing leaders from companies like Slack, Superhuman, and Shopify about how they've built great products and teams. More recently I've also been interviewing more founders, like [this episode with Charity Majors](https://www.itshipped.fm/episodes/19), co-founder of Honeycomb.

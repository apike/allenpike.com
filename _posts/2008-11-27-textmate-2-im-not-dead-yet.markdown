It's odd how something that seems like a perfect piece of software will start to aggravate you if it goes stale for long enough. I would be thrilled with a Textmate 1.6 that fixes a few bugs ((Multi-file search and replace bugs, especially. Argh.)), since it's still a capable editor. So, two years after 1.5 is released, I go hunting for [news](http://wiki.macromates.com/FAQ/TextMate2):

Uh oh. I smell [Second System effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect). [Peter Haza's reports](http://blog.peterhaza.no/textmate2-what-we-can-expect-to-come/) from the TextMate IRC channel earlier this year confirm it, listing many new features and saying it's a complete rewrite. Hopefully Allan Odgaard doesn't feel like Textmate 2 needs to be featureful enough to justify the wait, or the wait could never end.

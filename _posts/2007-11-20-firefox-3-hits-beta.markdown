Firefox 3 has [hit beta](http://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/index.php/2007/11/19/firefox-3-beta-1-now-available-for-download/), and it turns out [I'm not the only one who likes it](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20071120-afirst-look-at-firefox-3-beta-1.html). There are definitely still bugs though, so download it if you'd like your browsing to be more interesting. The worst thing is probably the Firebug, every web developer's favourite extension, is buggy under Firefox 3. Even if you run Firebug 1.1 beta (downloadable from [this sketchy site](http://fireclipse.xucia.com/#Downloads) or [from the project's svn repository](http://fbug.googlecode.com/svn/branches/firebug1.1/docs/ReleaseNotes_1.1.txt)) the live CSS editing doesn't work right.

David Gratton is [wondering if the new MacBook Air is like the ill-fated Power Mac Cube](http://www.davidrdgratton.com/blog/is-the-macbook-air-the-new-cube):


> I was about to place my order for the new [MacBook Air](http://www.apple.com/macbookair/) and everyone in my office was - "I wouldn't buy that. It looks nice, but it isn't worth it at that price."

Immediate flash back 7 years to the [Apple Cube](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Mac_G4_Cube). I was in the market for a new desktop and was about to buy The Cube and everyone in my office was - "I wouldn't buy that. It looks nice, but it isn't worth it at that price."


I think there's a more concrete reason the Air is like the Cube. It does slightly less and costs substantially more, but doesn't really do anything extra.

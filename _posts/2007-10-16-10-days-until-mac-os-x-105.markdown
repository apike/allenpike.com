Apple has posted an [extensive list of 300 new features in Leopard](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/300.html). The most interesting things on it that I didn't know from previous announcements or [WWDC 2006](http://www.antipode.ca/2006/report-from-wwdc-2006/):


> **Automatic Stop and Resume**
Never skip a beat. If your Time Machine backup is interrupted — because you took your portable on the road or put your Mac to sleep — Time Machine will simply stop backing up. When you reconnect to your backup drive again, TIme Machine automatically picks up where it left off.

**AutoFS**
Automatically mount and dismount network filesystems on separate threads to improve responsiveness and reliability.

**Live Partition Resizing in Disk Utility**
You may be able to gain disk space without losing data. If a volume is running out of space, simply delete the volume that comes after it on the disk and move the volume's end point into the freed space.

**New AirPort Menu**
Get a clearer picture of your surrounding Secure networks in the AirPort menu, Secure wireless networks are identified by a lock icon.

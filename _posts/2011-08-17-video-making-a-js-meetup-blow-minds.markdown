In May I gave [this 15 minute talk at JSConf](http://blip.tv/jsconf/jsconf2011-allen-pike-5454838) about putting together a great tech meetup, based on my experience putting on VanJS.



JSConf was the largest crowd I've presented to so far (about 200 by my count) but it was worth the pressure for sure. Any feedback on my presentation style would be really helpful. Maybe next year I'll give a talk entitled 'Eliminating all the "uh"s and head bobbing you see in videos of yourself giving talks'.

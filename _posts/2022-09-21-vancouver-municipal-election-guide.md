*Sep 21: With three weeks still to go before election day, this guide will evolve somewhat as polls, platforms, and other info continues to come in.*

In politics, you might expect that the bigger the stage, the richer the story. When somebody is running for Prime Minister or President, people take note. When you get down to the city level, things can seem kind of… low stakes. Heck, in Burnaby and Port Coquitlam, their [mayors were just acclaimed](https://vancouversun.com/news/politics/brad-west-acclaimed-mayor-port-coquitlam) – not a soul stepped up to run against them!

Vancouver is very not like this. We have a more engaged electorate and a disproportionate supply of cranks, which fuels an often dizzying mix of parties, candidates, and intrigue to follow and/or consider and/or be overwhelmed by. To make matters worse, information about candidates and their platforms tends to all roll out in a short period leading up to Election Day. This can make digesting everything buttload of work.

Luckily for you, dear reader, I have now done this buttload of work. I hope to ease your burden, and give you a useful overview of the tangled mess that is Vancouver politics. Assuming, that is, that you are a progressive sort of voter who cares about housing affordability. If you are a right-wing voter that thinks our city's housing situation is totally fine thank you, then you are free to hate-read this, but you may have a bad time.

In any case, on Oct 1, advance polling will open up and Vancouverites will have their say on who should hold the 11 votes on our City Council – 10 councillors, plus one mayor. So it’s time to recap how we got here, review the 9+ parties vying for your consideration, and finish off with some pointers on how to actually go vote.

Get a stiff drink, and settle in.

## How We Got Here

In some ways, this election is more straightforward than [the last](https://allenpike.com/2018/vancouver-election-guide). For example, there are slightly fewer Council candidates – 59, down from 71. There are fewer independents, fewer new faces, and far fewer “open” seats – the Mayor and 9 incumbent councillors are running to keep their jobs.

In other ways, this election is even *weirder* than 2018’s circus. So far we’ve seen new parties popping up left and right (though mostly right), leaked fundraising lists, and the dramatic implosion of Vancouver’s oldest party. It’s been a ride.

Last time around, Vancouver was in a serious housing crisis. It was bad, it was getting worse, and somebody had to *do something*. As a result, the incumbent Vision party was kicked to the curb. In their place, voters elected a mix of councillors from four different parties, along with an independent mayor – which resulted in no real working majority. 

While the intervening four years has seen a modest increase in housing permitted, and narrow approvals for plans to eventually permit more housing in the [Broadway corridor](https://thetyee.ca/News/2022/06/23/Councillors-Broadway-Plan-Votes/) and [city-wide](https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/vancouver-plan-final-approved-2050), it has often seen Council struggle to act. In their attempts push through and/or obstruct certain policy goals, Councillors have engaged in the sort of  [gnarly, inefficient, awkward kind of governance you would expect](https://twitter.com/j_mcelroy/status/1532794452040765440) when there’s no clear majority, every vote needs to come from an ad-hoc coalition, and many Councillors’ go-to move is to heap more work on city staff to research or report on this or that, instead of just making a plan and enacting it.

Meanwhile, the centre-right NPA – despite holding 5 of 10 Council seats – disintegrated over this term, sharding out into three different parties. The mayor, no doubt feeling left out as the sole independent, founded a party of his own as well. This has left us with Council’s 11 votes split across 7 parties, and a desperate need for an election to give someone, *anyone*, a mandate. Okay, maybe not *anyone* – but we’ll get to that.

<a name="crises"></a>
## The Crises
Vancouver continues to be in a serious housing shortage. It’s still bad, it’s still getting worse, and [somebody still has to *do something*](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/editorials/article-canadas-population-is-booming-and-we-arent-building-nearly-enough/). Something other than squabble over amendments to amendments at marathon council sessions, struggling until midnight to try and get agreement on approving a single apartment building, I mean. Something other than that.

Of course, housing isn’t the only crisis Vancouver has on its plate. We continue to suffer from a devastating loss of lives due to the poisoned drug supply, and we are also staring down a climate crisis. While other levels of government have a responsibility to help address all three of these crises, the city plays a role in each, and how we vote will depend what kind of role that will be.

Almost all the parties pay lip service to these priorities, so your mission, as a Vancouverite, is to pick some candidates that you think have a chance of delivering. Yes, City Hall has core responsibilities such as infrastructure, emergency services, property taxes, and zoning. Their biggest impact, though, will be how they do – or don’t – use these tools to address the bigger crises facing our city.

Excited yet? Let’s review the contestants.

<a name="parties"></a>
## A Party of Parties
You can’t boil a political party, comprised of various individuals each with their own nuanced take on the city’s issues, down to one or two simple axes. But. There are 9+ parties running candidates on a 59 person ballot. So I’m going to *start* by boiling each one down to one or two simple axes. Don’t hate me.

<img src="/images/2022/vancouver-parties-graph-2022.png" />

The excellent Cambie Report podcast has again [crowdsourced popular perceptions](https://twitter.com/CambieReport/status/1572261039865208833?s=20&t=SznFBrIGRpbHnLGnTZdIqg) of each party’s politics on two key dimensions, which I’ve charted above. What do the labels on this chart really mean, though? Let’s review in broad strokes.

**Urbanists** generally advocate for a denser, less car-oriented city. In practical terms this means substantially increasing the pace that new housing is approved, accelerating the rollout of the new Vancouver Plan priorities such as more density and “complete streets”, and in general being willing to “rock the boat” to build so much housing that affordability meaningfully improves. Most parties today claim affordability as a priority, urbanist parties tend to specify exactly how they intend to create a lot more housing supply. Urbanist voters are most likely to be looking at [OneCity](#onecity), [Forward Together](#forward), and [Progress Vancouver](#progress).

**Conservationists**, by contrast, are concerned about change in their backyards. Conservationists prefer a measured or even minimal approach to development, preserving the existing character of their neighbourhoods, protecting detached homes, and leveraging community consultation to defend the housing they already have – even if their critics call them NIMBYs. While this is a popular mindset among landowners, it’s also common amongst older renters who are currently well-housed and are more concerned about their neighbourhood or rent changing than they are about the broader housing shortage – if they even see it as a shortage at all. Extreme conservationist voters will be excited about [TEAM](#team), whereas folks that merely have concerns about the pace of change may be looking at the [Green Party](#green), [COPE](#cope), or the [NPA](#npa).

**Left** wing parties tend to favour allocating more spending and protections to those in need. In the context of Vancouver politics, this can mean approving and funding housing for the homeless, reallocating spending from police towards mental health and harm reduction services, and putting the interests of renters before those of landowners. [COPE](#cope), [OneCity](#onecity), and [Forward Vancouver](#forward) are examples of prominent left-wing parties this election.

**Right** wing voters are relatively rare in Vancouver, but on a *relative* basis, we have voters and parties that are less progressive than others, and in that way they form Vancouver’s right. The go-to campaign issues for these parties are “public safety” and keeping our [property taxes famously low](https://www.sightline.org/2022/05/09/how-low-taxes-lead-to-high-home-prices-in-vancouver-bc/). The [NPA](#npa), Vancouver’s longstanding centre-right party, has swung so far to the right this time around, that most of their councillors have defected to [ABC](#abc) and [TEAM](#team), the two new parties that make up Vancouver’s right of centre.

<a name="change"></a>
## What kind of change do you want, exactly?
Last election, electors deemed the long-incumbent Vision party to blame for the housing crisis and Vancouver’s other problems, reducing them from majority control to exactly zero seats. People wanted change, and they got change.

Four years later, housing prices have only gotten worse, as has the overdose crisis. A [recent survey by Leger](https://leger360.com/surveys/voter-sentiments-and-community-involvement-2022-b-c-municipal-elections/) found only 27% of residents approve of current Council, with only 29% approving of the mayor’s performance. 67% of people think it’s time for a change, but the big question is: what kind of change?

What change you seek will likely depend on how you allocate blame for Council’s gridlock. Do you blame Mayor Stewart, who has but one of Council’s 11 votes but is its figurehead and most prominent member? Do you blame the Councillors who most often [voted against or otherwise obstructed](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-council-mayor-votes-1.6573186) his efforts to permit more homes? Or do you blame the whole group of them – kick everybody out again, maybe this time even decade-long Green Councillor Adriane Carr, and re-roll Council a second time, hoping the result is more coherent this time around?

Besides considering where you lay the blame, it’s worth considering how other voters may land. Traditionally, there is a huge incumbency advantage in municipal politics: folks who run again typically win about 80% of the time. Even in 2018’s “clean slate” election, 2 of the 3 councillors who ran again kept their seats.

So, while pure-hearted idealists can simply fill their ballots with the candidates they like the most, those of us cursed with a strategic mindset will be also considering electability, and whether it’s worth voting for a couple incumbents who we consider just “okay” with the idea that they’re better than some of the truly terrifying alternatives on the ballot.

<a name="ballot"></a>
## Building a ballot
Regardless of your approach, your mission is to pick 1 Mayor and 10 Councillors. (You also get to pick 9 for School Board and 7 for Park Board, but I’ve focused on Council here.) Since no party is running a full set of 11 candidates, and the overall ballot is quite long, I suggest using [Vancouver’s “Plan Your Vote” tool](https://vancouver.ca/plan-your-vote/) to check off candidates who pique your interest.

Without further ado, here is a primer on each of the 9 parties that are running multiple candidates, sorted roughly from most urbanist to most conservationist.

<a name="onecity"></a>
## OneCity
Arguably Vancouver’s most progressive party, OneCity has a consistent set of urbanist and leftist stances on the city’s issues. Now that we can add to that 4 years of OneCity Councillor **Christine Boyle**’s voting record, we can confirm that, yes, this is a party pushes to permit a lot more housing, fund social housing, take action on climate, and just generally, you know, push for progress.

That said, with only 1 vote out of 11, OneCity has only been able to do that – *push* for progress. While in some cases they were the deciding vote on a given housing initiative or progressive cause, in other cases they [found themselves with little support](https://twitter.com/christineeboyle/status/1397431785676414976) on the current council, pushing for motions that only drew votes from one or two of the more urbanist or leftist members. To have a big impact, OneCity simply needs more votes at City Hall.

The party’s [platform](https://www.onecityvancouver.ca/platform) hopes to deliver that, including a call to  [create non-police response teams](https://vancouver.citynews.ca/2022/09/19/onecity-peer-mental-health-teams/) that can respond to mental health crises, and a call to “[end the apartment ban](https://vancouversun.com/opinion/columnists/dan-fumano-ending-vancouvers-apartment-ban-is-it-progress-or-disaster)”, allowing new rentals and social housing in all neighbourhoods.

If this kind of approach appeals to you, you’ll want to seriously consider voting for Boyle and OneCity’s new candidates: health economist **Ian Cromwell**, senior transportation planner **Iona Bonamis**, and indigenous leader **Matthew Norris**.

On the question of electability, OneCity is the only party to have all their candidates endorsed by the Vancouver Labour and District Council, or VDLC. While VDLC has long helped rally progressive voters towards an electable slate of candidates, their misstep in 2018 of endorsing 4 Vision candidates may have reduced their credibility at correctly forecasting electability. That said, 5/7 of VDLC’s non-Vision picks were elected last time around, so [2022’s Vision-less slate](https://vdlc.ca/vdlc-endorses-municipal-candidates/) may be a useful tool for progressive voters trying to make sense of many options.

Like the other progressive parties, OneCity has refrained from running a mayoral candidate, implicitly supporting Mayor Kennedy Stewart’s re-election. Their hope is that time around, he’ll have enough progressives and urbanists on Council to make some bigger changes.

<a name="progress"></a>
## Progress Vancouver
In 2018, a new party called YES Vancouver took a sort of “housing-only” platform to voters that promised to permit more housing, while avoiding taking many stances on the social or economic side of things. After a rather poor showing in terms of votes, the organization has completely rebooted itself for 2022, as Progress Vancouver.

Headed by mayoral candidate and political strategist **Mark Marissen**, Progress has built their campaign around an appropriately bold plan to address the housing shortage, comparable in scale to what other urbanist parties are proposing. While Progress has a pretty crisp message on housing, their non-housing politics seem to vary a lot between candidates. Put simply, the fact their candidates include both former NDP candidate **Morgane Oger** and NPA defector **Mauro Francis** makes it seem more like a “anybody’s welcome as long as you’re down for more housing” party than one that has a strict opinion on what “progress” means – at least as far as socioeconomics goes.

If you’re a single-issue voter on the topic of housing supply, you may do well to investigate Progress’ other candidates: film producer **May He**, actor **David Chin**, business owner **Asha Hayer**, and DTES volunteer **Marie Noelle Rosa**.

<a name="forward"></a>
## Forward Together
When Mayor **Kennedy Stewart** ran as an Independent in 2018, he surely hoped he’d be leading a Council that shared his progressive urbanist politics. Instead, he got a mixed bag of Councillors, with no clear majority to implement his vision – a position I’ve seen described as mayoral candidates’ worst nightmare.

One one hand, Stewart has pulled off some successes from this difficult position, such as the narrow passage of the Broadway Plan and Vancouver Plan, and [permitting a record number of new homes in 2021](https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/vancouver-new-housing-approvals-2021). On the other hand, he has led a Council that is perceived as dysfunctional and slow to address the scale of our city’s crises – nobody wants a repeat of that this time around.

To this end, Stewart has formed the Forward Together party, a group of Council candidates he hopes to have on his side as a more coherent voting bloc. In what may not be a coincidence, Forward is running 6 Council candidates and a mayor, which paired together with the 4 Council candidates from ideologically similar OneCity makes for a full ballot.

While as of Sep 21 [their platform details](https://www.forwardvancouver.ca/) are a little thin, Forward’s fundamental pitch is that Mayor Stewart has been pushing things in the right direction – a progressive and urbanist one – but hasn’t had the votes to fully get the job done. So, if you re-elect him with a team that shares his vision, they’ll be able to double down and make progress more effectively.

Of course, as frontrunner and incumbent, Stewart has been the focus of some minor… maybe not quite scandals, but brouhahas maybe? The weirdest was certainly a [leaked fundraising list that included property developers](https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/local-news/mayor-kennedy-stewart-donor-list-vancouver-bc-5847463), plus there have been ABC’s [claims that Stewart will implement a road tax](https://www.straight.com/news/kennedy-stewart-claims-and-abc-vancouver-denies-that-ken-sims-road-tax-ads-were-pulled-for) that the City does not actually have jurisdiction to implement.

In the end though, Forward’s success at the polls will probably depend on whether enough voters see Council’s dysfunction as being in spite of Stewart’s efforts, rather than because of them.

If you would like to vote for some Forward candidates but not all six, there are a few tacks you could take. If you’re looking for progressive cred, they have three former NDP candidates on the ballot, **Dulcy Anderson**, **Tesicca Truong**, and Stewart’s wife, **Jeanette Ashe**. VDLC has endorsed Anderson, as well as Stewart’s communications chief **Alvin Singh**. Forward’s team for Council also includes accessibility advocate **Hilary Brown** and software developer **Russil Wvong**.

<a name="vision"></a>
## Vision
When the last election saw a resounding rejection of Vision – they were reduced from a council majority to zero seats – some speculated the party was done. However, it seems some are still loyal to the Vision – at least, loyal enough to make use of the once-powerful party’s remaining funds and contact lists and give things a real college try.

Honestly, I’m not sure what to make of Vision’s campaign. On paper they have a reasonable urbanist-left platform – similar to Forward Together’s – and the party has name recognition, so it seems like their candidates could be electable. So far, though, they just don’t seem to much in the way of momentum, endorsements, buzz, or… anything.

Vision’s three Council candidates – teacher **Stuart Mackinnon**, communications strategist **Lesli Boldt**, and doctor **Honieh Barzegari** – might be competent enough, but in an election this crowded, after such a clear rejection in 2018, do they have any chance of cracking the top 10? Not clear. Is that a good enough reason to refrain from voting for them? I don’t know, man.

<a name="abc"></a>
## A Better City Vancouver
The centre-right is an interesting place in Vancouver politics. Here in the core of a progressive metropolitan area, not being lefty enough can be a liability. For example, a policy like committing to hiring more police officers – something that would hardly raise an eyebrow in most jurisdictions – is seen as a right of centre position here in Vancouver.

If that kind of right-of-centre politics appeals to you, you’ll want to consider ABC Vancouver. Led by mayoral candidate **Ken Sim** – last election’s runner-up – ABC has done a good job of capitalizing on the NPA’s recent implosion and establishing itself as a credible alternative to those who have voted NPA in previous elections. They’ve signed on sitting councillors **Rebecca Bligh**, **Lisa Dominato**, and **Sarah Kirby-Yung**, who are running for ABC after resigning from the NPA in 2021. Joining the incumbent Councillors on the ABC slate are **Mike Klassen**, **Peter Meiszner**, **Brian Montague**, and **Lenny Zhou**.

While ABC’s economic policies may appeal to those on the right – cut waste at City Hall, hire police officers, oppose any new taxes on private vehicles – Ken Sim seems to have sharpened his pencil on housing since last election. They’ve committed to triple the number of housing starts, and their sitting councillors have voted to approve more housing than some of the most conservationist on Council. When it comes to drugs, you will see more promises around “public safety” than “harm reduction” or “safe supply”, which is in line with the centre-right mindset of the party.

While Sim seems to have his rhetoric focused on forerunner Kennedy Stewart, it seems as if ABC’s candidates may be competing for votes more directly against TEAM and the NPA on one side, and the Greens and Progress on the other. Still, ABC is perhaps the most likely party to win a majority this election. If progressive voters aren’t keen on that idea, they’ll need to show up at the polls with something else in mind.

<a name="cope"></a>
## COPE
At one time, COPE was what it said on the tin: a coalition of progressive electors, who got a progressive majority elected back in 2002. Since then, COPE’s representation on on Council has dwindled, and currently consists of the one, the only, **Jean Swanson**. Swanson’s unapologetically principled brand of leftist politics captured voters’ imagination in 2018, and she’s been consistent in her conduct as Councillor in the years since. That is to say, she votes against anything that doesn’t seem like a clear win for the homeless or less privileged. COPE’s politics tend to see protecting renters’ existing housing as a higher priority than increasing the availability or affordability of housing for those who need to move, which has put her in conflict with those on the left who see housing supply as an urgent need.

When it comes to housing, City Hall observers have often noted the irony that Swanson, arguably the city’s leftmost Councillor, and Colleen Hardwick, the city’s rightmost Councillor, often see their diametrically opposing political views drive them to the same outcome: voting no to conserve the status quo. If you like the status quo then that’s maybe good, but 67% of Vancouverites think it’s time for a change, I’m unsure whether more COPE votes is going to get us there.

Like the other progressive parties, COPE is not running a mayoral candidate. They might not agree with Mayor Stewart on housing, but he’s a better ally than they’ll find elsewhere on the ballot for their social policies. 

If you’re a progressive voter more concerned about renter protections and housing the homeless than you are about the cost of housing more generally, you may consider voting for Swanson as well as COPE’s other candidates,  activist **Nancy Trigueros**, lawyer **Breen Ouellette**, and social worker **Tanya Webking**.

<a name="green"></a>
## Green
Vancouver’s Green Party engenders complex feelings in many progressive voters. One one hand, they have a great brand that’s won 3 somewhat progressive votes on Council. On the other hand, they have at times delayed action when it comes to building housing, social or otherwise. While there is increasing support for the idea that densification is one of the highest impact things cities can do on climate, the Greens have at times have had their minds elsewhere, such as directing staff to, say, [research options for procuring more plant-based food](https://council.vancouver.ca/20211102/documents/b3.pdf). Which isn’t a bad thing! But isn’t housing.

Truly making sense of the Greens is challenging in part because the party is not very prescriptive about its views or platform. Sitting councillors **Adriane Carr**, **Pete Fry**, and **Michael Wiebe** each act independently, going their own way on various issues, which has contributed to the the complexity of getting clear and efficient plans through City Hall.

While VDLC has endorsed all three sitting Green candidates, voters may want to do a bit of research on each Councillor’s record before casting a vote. If progressive values and climate actions *other* than bold action on housing are key to you, then you may also want to consider new Green candidates, climate scientist **Devyani Singh** and activist **Stephanie Smith**.

<a name="npa"></a>
## NPA
The NPA has been an institution in Vancouver politics since 1937. It has run eleven elected mayors – including former premier Gordon Campbell – and since 2008 has been slowly making gains at City Hall, most recently coming within 1000 votes of winning a majority.

Then, it imploded.

Like, completely went haywire. Their board was taken over by [far-right clowns](https://thetyee.ca/News/2021/01/21/Worries-Rise-NPA-Vancouver-Extremist-Candidates-2022/), all their Councillors left the party except one, multiple new parties have sprung up in the hope of replacing them, they [lost the mayoral candidate](https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/dan-fumano-past-npa-mayoral-candidate-ken-sim-to-run-again-against-the-npa) that almost won them the election last time, they [lost the replacement mayoral candidate](https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/local-news/john-coupar-resigns-npa-candidate-mayor-vancouver-bc-5663520) halfway through election season, and as replacement-replacement they brought in **Fred Harding**, who came in 6th last election, so that he could announce that “[The NPA has not imploded](https://subscriptions.cbc.ca/newsletter_static/messages/metromatters/2022-09-03/)”.

So I guess it's up for debate. Did the NPA implode, or did they collapse? Was it sabotage, perhaps? In any case, this is likely to be a down year for them.

One of the most interesting questions for voters who lean right is, do they re-elect the sole remaining NPA Councillor, **Melissa De Genova**? She pulled in the 3rd most votes of any Councillor in 2018, so it stands to reason that she could be re-electable. On the other hand, every other NPA Councillor bailed on the organization, citing a conflict of values with the party’s new direction. It’s kind of a bad look.

In terms of campaign promises, the NPA seems very focused on a crime and safety message, which which is a pretty traditional right-wing platform plank and not nearly as interesting as all the party drama.

Speaking of drama, the internet was recently flummoxed by the revolution that NPA Council candidate and realtor **Morning Lee** posted an instructional video on how to evict tenants during COVID, which included [instructions to make sure you drop a deuce in their toilet](https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/bc-news/take-a-poop-to-assert-ownership-during-eviction-says-vancouver-city-council-candidate-5833670), so as to assert your sovereignty over the tenants’ home. But crime and safety, yes yes very serious.

<a name="team"></a>
## TEAM for a Livable Vancouver
As City Councillor, **Colleen Hardwick** has developed a reputation for saying no. No to housing, no to spending, no to change. Should we build the [wildly popular](https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/ubc-skytrain-public-support-survey) SkyTrain extension to UBC? No. Should we take bold action to address the housing shortage? No – because there *is no housing shortage*. 🤯

In Hardwick’s view, planning should be a slow process done neighbourhood by neighbourhood, if not block by block, so that each area’s most vocal residents can veto improvements that may risk making Vancouver a better place. Hardwick sees the growing academic and popular consensus that cities must permit more housing as backwards, and she’s willing to belittle colleagues and residents to make this point.

It seems Hardwick became so frustrated being Vancouver’s most conservative Councillor that instead of running for re-election, she’s formed her own party to run for Mayor. Mercifully, she’s unlikely to succeed. Other Councillors must be thanking their stars that [polling is placing her support at only 17%](https://researchco.ca/2022/09/08/vanpoli-sept2022/).

Still, 17% is not nothing! Especially in the small sample sizes of municipal polling. While TEAM’s votes are likely to come from a mix of cranky old landowners and low-information voters, they may pull enough votes to play spoiler for development-skeptical candidates running for ABC, the NPA, or perhaps the Greens.

On the other hand, Hardwick’s candidacy is helpful for progressive parties’ get out the vote efforts. Her rhetoric and actions are so antithetical to the values of leftist and urbanist voters that the mere chance of her being Mayor could help get folks out of bed and into polling stations come October 15. Seriously, [do not let this person become mayor](https://twitter.com/shaunasylvester/status/1569743816072040451).

<a name="bonus"></a>
## Bonus Round: The not-independents
In 2018, a lot of folks ran for Councillor as independents. As a rule, they fared poorly. This time around, candidates have mostly rallied around one party or another, with the interesting upshot that two folks are each running for Council as a party of one (at least as far as Council candidates go).

Columnist **Sean Orr** is the candidate for Vote Socialist, a sort of splinter group from COPE that is forging its own path. Its platform seems similar to COPE, but with a higher priority on building social housing.

Civil Engineer **Eric Redmond** is the candidate for the Affordable Housing Coalition, which may sound like a NIMBY-type group but is actually a single-issue party centered on housing supply – not too unlike Progress Vancouver, at least in principle.

<a name="vote"></a>
## Time to Plan… That… Vote!
Turnout in municipal elections is infamously low – 39% in 2018 – which means the outcome will really depend on who gets their butts in gear and casts a ballot, and who stays at home and scrolls social media.

If you’ve taken the time to peruse a voting guide, you surely know that voting is worthwhile, *but* without a specific plan you’re less likely to actually cast your vote. You’ve got three main options – put one in your calendar:

1. You can vote by mail, but to receive a package in the mail you need to [request a package here](https://vancouver.ca/election/2022/vote-by-mail.aspx) before **Thursday, Sep 29** at 5pm.
2. Cool kids vote early. Advance voting will be possible in select locations on Sat **Oct 1**, Wed **Oct 5**, Sat **Oct 8**, Tue **Oct 11**, and Thu **Oct 13**.
3. Election Day city-wide will be on Saturday, **October 15**.

Between now and then, use the [Plan Your Vote](https://vancouver.ca/plan-your-vote/) tool, along with some of the starting points in this guide, to find some candidates that seem like they have a shot at making Vancouver a better place.

Cast your vote – it’s in you to give.

For new readers wondering where I’m coming from: I’m a thirty-something parent and small business owner who owns a townhome in East Vancouver. I’m an advocate for affordable housing who believes Vancouver should be a welcoming place for all, not just people who already have wealth or land.

Finally, a huge thank you to the [Cambie Report](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+cambie+report&oq=the+cambie+report&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i60l3.1893j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), their patrons, and [Ian Bushfield](https://twitter.com/ibushfield) in particular, who have been generous with their time helping me better understand the twisty maze that is Vancouver politics.

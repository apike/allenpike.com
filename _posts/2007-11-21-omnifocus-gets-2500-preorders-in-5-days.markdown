OmniFocus, the upcoming Mac task-management app, [has received $100k of pre-orders in the first 5 days](http://blog.omnigroup.com/2007/11/21/whoa-100000-in-under-five-days/) ((Via [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/november#wed-21-omnifocus).)). Although the recurring revenue of web apps is appealing to a lot of new developers, this is a reminder that there's a lot of money to be made from a good old native Mac app.

![A long tail of tunes.](/images/wp-uploads/2007/11/itunes_tail.jpg)Chris Anderson's book [The Long Tail](http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1401302378?ie=UTF8&tag=alteringtime-20&linkCode=as2&camp=15121&creative=330641&creativeASIN=1401302378) highlights how nowadays, what's the most popular matters less and less. For example, Amazon has hundreds of thousands of books that would never even fit in a bookstore generating a large portion of its profit. Its main lesson is not to count out the long tail of occasionally-useful creations that trails off into obscurity.

I recently discovered that this phenomenon applies on much smaller scales too. I have an older 2GB iPod nano, and must select a subset of my music so it will fit. My initial setup was to have it take the songs rated 3/5 or above ((For those iTunes users who have not yet rated their songs, trust me that it's worth doing. It may seem like a momentous task, but if you listen to your tunes more than an hour a day, the cost/benefit ratio is worth it. Rating your songs lets you do great things with Smart Playlists and your iPod.)), with certain conditions. At first this was enjoyable, but I began to get sick of this fraction of my music. About half of my library was rated 2/5 or 1/5 and I was never hearing it at all.

People have asked me why I even have songs rated 1/5. If they're so bad, why not delete them? The answer ((Sorry if this is obvious, but multiple intelligent people have found this unintuitive.)) is that if all your songs are rated 3+, you've just compressed your ratings to be out of 3 rather than out of 5. If you define 1/5 as worth having, but in the bottom 20%, then you can make use of the full 5 star rating resolution.

So, to freshen things up, I had the iPod also load some lower-rated songs, on the condition that I hadn't heard them in months. What an improvement! Although I almost never want to hear White and Nerdy by Weird Al, every few months it's great for 3 minutes. It turns out that if you treat your favourite music as your only music, it becomes like a Greatest Hits album that you get sick of. If instead you treat it like a radio station, where sometimes there are okay songs and sometimes there are awesome songs, your whole experience is a lot better.

Firefox 3.1, which is [now in alpha](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080730-first-look-ars-reviews-firefox-3-1-alpha-1.html), joins Webkit/Safari in supporting the CSS3 border-image, text-shadow, and box-shadow properties. As those who've used [border-image on iPhone-specific sites](http://iphoneminds.com/2008/02/part-7-taking-advantage-of-web-kit-css.html) know, it can make creating beautiful buttons and boxes a lot less messy than existing techniques. text-shadow and box-shadow are more practical to use soon, since if your IE7 users don't see that kind of extra polish, it might not be a big deal, yet you can keep your site resources and images simpler. After many years of wishful thinking, CSS3 is finally coming true.

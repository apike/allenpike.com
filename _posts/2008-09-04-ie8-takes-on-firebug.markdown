John Hrvatin at Microsoft announced some details about [IE 8 beta 2's developer tools](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/09/03/developer-tools-in-internet-explorer-8-beta-2.aspx) today. They've echoed Webkit in putting their spin on Firebug's awesome developer features, and integrating them into the browser. Element inspection, inline HTML and CSS editing, JS profiling, console.log support, and lots more. Plus, it works in IE7 mode, so it should be useful today for making sites work in IE7. Getting your Javascript and CSS to work right in IE just got easier, easing one of the biggest pains of web development.

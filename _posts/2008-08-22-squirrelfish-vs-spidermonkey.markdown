![](/images/wp-uploads/2008/08/javascript_avatars.jpg)Both Mozilla and Webkit have recently announced drastic performance improvements to their Javascript engines. Both Webkit's [SquirrelFish](http://webkit.org/blog/189/announcing-squirrelfish/) and Mozilla's [SpiderMonkey](http://shaver.off.net/diary/2008/08/22/the-birth-of-a-faster-monkey/) are sure to shake up the Javascript world for the better. This is all the more exciting given the [new activity in the ECMA standardization process](http://yuiblog.com/blog/2008/08/14/premature-standardization/) that might bring new life to the language.

As important as those things are, there's a bigger question here. Which project's multi-animal portmanteau of a name looks cooler when rendered artistically? The SpiderMonkey has a definite cute factor, and seems much more likely to leap into action, just in time. The SquirrelFish, however is more original, and has a modest demeanour that shows his dedication to executing Javascript rapidly.

Which creature would you trust with your code?

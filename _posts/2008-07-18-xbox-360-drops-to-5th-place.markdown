I had resigned myself to the thought that Microsoft was on its way to dominating the console gaming market, but [according to Ars Technica, that may not be the case](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080718-npd-nintendo-wii-the-top-selling-current-gen-console.html):


> Having been surpassed by the PSP, the Xbox 360 sat in fifth place for June, having only moved 219,800 systems. Combined with the fact that the 360 version of _Grand Theft Auto_ _I__V_ has fallen completely off the top ten list, Microsoft's sales seem less than stellar.


Surpassed by the lowly PSP? Yikes. Maybe XBox Vista will have better luck.

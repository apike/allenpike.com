I wrote today about [Steamclock’s new Managing Director](https://steamclock.com/blog/2024/04/managing-director) over on the company blog:

> Building something that lasts requires you to relentlessly change and improve. For years, Steamclock was tiny and unknown – originally just two folks in a basement. Over time though, we put in the work to grow into one of the top product studios in the world. While our team is still fairly small (we’re now 16 strong) our business is increasingly growing – in recent years, by 20% annually. Rather than any big breakthrough, this growth has always been driven by the same thing: great people making small improvements that add up.

I’ll have more to share about what I’m building next in the coming months. For today, I'm feeling grateful for what we’ve built at Steamclock, and the fact it’s still growing and improving.

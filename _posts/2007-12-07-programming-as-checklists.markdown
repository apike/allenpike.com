Curtis "the Lassam" Lassam thinks that the [fascinating New Yorker article on checklists in ICUs](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/12/10/071210fa_fact_gawande?currentPage=1) works as [a big metaphor for programming](http://www.curtis.lassam.net/?p=325). Also, he references Dr. Pibb, which is awesome.

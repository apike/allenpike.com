![The noble writers I link to here do their first drafts with a quill.](/images/wp-uploads/2009/11/writing.jpg)In response to my [recent crusade](http://www.antipode.ca/2009/primary-sources/) for feed unsubscription, I was asked who I'm still reading. Out of my remaining feeds, here are two active favourites from each of my categories, with a link to a recent article that I appreciate from each one ((I'm linking to specific articles partially because I think I've linked to every single one of these people before, with the exception of the comics. Still, writing this was a great exercise in thinking about who I'm inspired by.)).


## Web Programming


My web development reading is centered around Javascript since it's my working language right now. [Francisco Tolmasky](http://www.alertdebugging.com/2009/04/29/building-a-better-javascript-profiler-with-webkit/), one of the creators of Cappuccino, writes thoughtfully and infrequently on building thick client web apps.

[John Resig](http://ejohn.org/blog/deep-tracing-of-internet-explorer/), creator of JQuery, has a similarly consistent blog on pushing boundaries with Javascript.


## Business of Software


If you're fascinated by the startup world, [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) is a staple.

For more applied thoughts on software business and product design, I read [Signal vs. Noise](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1941-press-release-37signals-valuation-tops-100-billion-after-bold-vc-investment). I've looked up to the 37signals guys since I came across them almost ten years ago, and their "do less" mantra has always resonated with me.


## Vancouver Notables


I don't generally follow people just because they're local, but there are lots of people worth reading that are in town. [Boris Mann](http://bmannconsulting.com/blog/bmann/federated-micro-blogging-canadian-startup-networking) is a central figure in the Vancouver tech and startup scenes.

[Dave Shea](http://mezzoblue.com/archives/2009/04/20/switched/) is a central figure in standards-based web design, and gets super bonus points for introducing me to The Alibi Room.


## Design


For Mac-centric design writing, [Cocoia](http://blog.cocoia.com/2009/snow-leopard-ui-roundup/) is top notch.

On the more technical side, [Jon Snook](http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/shifting-opinion-css-animations) writes on a mix of design and web programming.


## Fun Stuff


I try to keep my feeds professionally oriented - getting distracted is enough of a danger without it being fed into your system automatically. That said, the geeky dark humour of [SMBC](http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&id=1684) and [Zero Punctuation](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/457-Mirrors-Edge) are classics.


## Projects


RSS is perfect for subscribing to feeds of projects you use, even if they rarely update. It kicks mailing list ass, that's for sure. The [SproutCore Blog](http://blog.sproutcore.com/post/242640501/bespin-builds-on-sproutcore), for example, is great for me as a user of the framework.

[Google Chrome Releases](http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2009/11/dev-channel-update_13.html) takes the format of the wonderful Burning Edge, and is great for me since I live on the Chrome Mac development builds.


## Friends


I'm blessed with many friends who write about technology. Forced to pick a top two, I'd name [Curtis Lassam](http://www.curtis.lassam.net/?p=841) and [Bruce Alderson](http://warpedvisions.org/2009/07/04/the-zen-and-art-of-editing-text/). Both write well on both web technology and creative topics, and I think of their blogs as cousins to Antipode.


## Apple


[John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/2009/10/pound_the_quality) is in some of ways the pulse of the Apple geek community. It is with reluctance I'm still subscribed to his high-volume links feed rather than simply full posts ((Daring Fireball has by far the highest post volume in my feed reader, and often posts things he doesn't have in-depth knowledge of. On the other hand, the link mix and annotation are so good that they stay on my list.)), but a posts-only feed is available too.

On serious Mac development, I read [Cocoa with Love](http://cocoawithlove.com/2009/10/objective-c-niche-why-it-survives-in.html). I'm a novice Objective-C developer, so Matt's in-depth Cocoa development posts sometimes go over my head, but that's the point. If you're not reading some things that go over your head, you're in trouble.


## More


I'm always trimming my feeds and keeping an eye out for more. Do you have any suggestions based on my this list or my topics here?

Nowadays, 5% of my readers are using Google Chrome, which can't be chalked up to the "giving it a spin" effect from September. Now, Google is [turning up the heat](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/google-chrome-beta.html):


> We're excited to announce that with today's fifteenth release we are taking off the "beta" label! ... We have removed the beta label as our goals for stability and performance have been met but our work is far from done. We are working to add some common browser features such as form autofill and RSS support in the near future. We are also developing an extensions platform along with support for Mac and Linux.


I love what they're doing with the Location Bar ([my favourite part of a browser](http://www.antipode.ca/2008/your-browsers-command-line/)) but until there's a Mac version I won't be able to really challenge it.

I've created a comments feature that automatically links blog posts to Forum topics. Rather than being a total boron and forcing people who want to comment to create WordPress accounts, this takes advantage of Altering Time's existing logins.

As posts go by, comment on them! Tell me which ones suck, and which ones you'd like to see more of. I believe I can determine what the true topic of this blog is - with just your help, some luck, determination, dedication, rumination, concentration... interpolation... and a big pile of cash.

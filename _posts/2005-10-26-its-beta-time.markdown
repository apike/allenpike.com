It's finally here! After a year and a half of planning, design, development, bugfixing, balancing, redesign, discussion, balancing, disorientation, discombobulation, dismantling, remantling, balancing, caffeine, panic, and the occasional beer, Engineering Faith is now in Beta Testing.

Before I go further, I want to give a huge thanks to my loyal Alpha testers. Andy_R, Chris, Elephant Man, Karen, Kate, Lola, mx, nitsua, Ãœbersoldat, and Zeero all suffered versions of Faith that sucked many times more than it does now. Not only that, but each and every one of them made a serious effort to help me make it suck less, even when I insisted the game wasn't too slow and that a random arrow was a great symbol for Convert. We'll be having a Beta Party next month that I'll give details for later, and I'll be buying each one of them who can make it a drink.

So, what does Beta mean, really? It means new players will be invited at about 10 times the rate they have been previously. As I said in my last post, I'm going to start seriously tackling Help, Strategy Balance, Interface, and Player Management. So if you're dying to test things out, try [requesting an invite](/faith/request.php) or ask somebody you know is playing and they might be able to invite you. At the moment people can only invite somebody who has registered on the site already, but that will change sooner or later.

So, thanks for all your patience, and I hope to see you in-game soon!

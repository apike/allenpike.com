![](/images/wp-uploads/2009/01/wesabe.png)A couple years ago I started writing a web app called [Budgetable](http://www.budgetable.com/) to track my savings and spending by importing data from my bank. Although other projects pushed it to the wayside, it stayed a pretty useful expense tracking tool for me.

Since then, a couple startups have jumped into this game, and have outpaced my poor prototype by many miles. As Budgetable languishes, the least I can do is find a replacement for my loyal users-in-waiting (including myself.) So I tested out these two up and coming apps, and we have a clear winner: [Wesabe](http://www.wesabe.com/) ((Wesabe, not Wasabe. Wasabe.com is held by domain squatters, which is greeeat.)).

Why did Wesabe beat out [Mint.com](http://www.mint.com/)? Well, it supported Canadian banks! So it won by a factor of infinity. But in all honesty, it does everything I envisioned Budgetable would do, except for some UI issues. My review follows:

**The Good**



	
  * Imports from a lot of banks, some automatically

	
  * Has a reasonable dashboard with your total sum across accounts

	
  * Allows you to graph spending on categories that you define

	
  * It realizes that if JJ Bean was coffee last week it's probably coffee this week


**The Bad**



	
  * Doesn't show you positive feedback for saving over time

	
  * Noisy UI has some weird decisions and distractions ((Maybe I'll do an unsolicited redesign proposal to practice my design chops.))

	
  * Deals poorly with banks that have two levels of password

	
  * Too much focus on the social aspects, instead of "show me the money"


**The Ugly**



	
  * The thought supporting all those banks in Budgetable

	
  * Alignment issues on the left sidebar - if you're a print designer, do NOT go in there


**The Bottom Line**

On the whole, it's a win. All the Wesabe guys need to do is hire somebody with sharp, clear UI and design skills, and they'll have a great product on their hands. Until they do, I'll keep the source code for Budgetable just in case.

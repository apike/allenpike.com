As we grow at Steamclock – we’re now at 14 and [hiring our 15th](https://steamclock.com/careers/lead-ios-mobile-developer) – we’re getting more intentional about how we do things. I worry less about how to do the work, and more about how to build the team and our processes.

Which is great. But it’s a problem set that is a bit more… ambiguous. We want to constantly improve. But how do we separate the big opportunities from the stuff that’s a just-kinda-annoying reality of all product teams?

There's a sentiment I softimes hear when we’re considering these kinds of problems:

> **“Well it’s not great. But we’re already better at this than any company I’ve worked at before.”**

Which is nice to hear – we’re already the best! Phew. Maybe it’s just a hard problem, and nobody’s great at it. We can just move along and… wait a minute. Waiiit a minute.

We’re better at this than any company *you worked at before*. But how did things go for that company? Poorly enough that you left.

Since then, they’ve presumably gotten better. Meanwhile, we’re comparing ourselves to companies that couldn’t retain great team members, instead of the companies out there kicking ‘tocks and defining the new standard for how ‘tocks should be kicked effectively and profitably.

So while the past experience of your team members is invaluable, you need to be actively researching what other teams are doing. Find people who work at companies that do great work. Read what they write. When you can, build a relationship where you can share what you know and they can share what they know. Don't let yourself feel smugly superior to the last generation of companies.

Benchmark yourself against the folks kicking the most ‘tocks.

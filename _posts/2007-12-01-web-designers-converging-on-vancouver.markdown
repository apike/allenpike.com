[Web Directions North](http://north08.webdirections.org/) is a web development conference happening in Vancouver for two days at the end of January. Students get 75% off (for a total of $200), and for $120 more you can join them for a snow day at Whistler. Naturally local folks [Dave Shea](http://www.mezzoblue.com/) of CSS Zen Garden fame and [Boris Mann](http://bmannconsulting.com/) of Bryght will be speaking, but they're also flying in various notables, such as Daniel Burka of Digg and Chris Messina of [varietous open source fame](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Messina_(open_source_advocate)). Anyone interested in going?

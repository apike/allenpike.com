Over on the Steamclock blog, I recently wrote [an article about letting users review iOS apps](https://steamclock.com/blog/2019/09/app-reviews/):

> There are enough subtle pitfalls around the relevant APIs and App Store Guidelines that it can be easy to get this wrong. Conversations about app ratings often devolve into debates about what Apple will or won’t allow, and it’s hard to remember the exact details and limitations.

As with most product decisions, there's a naïve way that will get you started but could cause problems, and a series of more-thoughtful ways of doing it for those that want to do it well.

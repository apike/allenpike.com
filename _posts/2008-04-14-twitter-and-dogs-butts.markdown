I've been [having fun with Twitter](http://twitter.com/apike) in the last few weeks. It's sort of like a micro-blog, or a dedicated status app. It's a cool way that I can follow both people I know, and famous web designers and bloggers. Sometimes those famous web personalities post insightful technical commentary packaged in a nice 140-character package. Other times, they post about things coming out of dogs' asses. ((Both [Jeffery Zeldman](http://twitter.com/zeldman/statuses/775831027) and [John Gruber](http://twitter.com/gruber/statuses/789108573) posted about this very thing in the last little while. Maybe I should make a Twitter app that only shows tech-related tweets... or at least one that filters out canine rectal tweets.)) A weird contrast.

I talk to a lot different companies about their mobile app plans. Sometimes they have a really compelling business case for an app. Sometimes getting a quality app their customers' hands is the key to supercharging their business, and is something that will pay dividends for years.

More often, it is... not that. Usually they just need a website.

So my team made a checklist to [help explain to folks why they might (but probably don't) need an app](https://shouldyoubuildamobile.app/).

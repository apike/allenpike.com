GLEN COVE, NY, USA - Sounds easy, doesn't it? Acclaim Entertainment is making this offer to one special couple. The first couple to name their baby "Turok" on Sunday, September 1st, will get $10 000 in savings bonds. They must register on the website at [http://www.turok.com/baby/](http://www.turok.com/baby/) beforehand, and their baby's first name must remain "Turok" for at least one year. While this seems like a large sum of money, it's all in the name of pumping up publicity (such as this article) for the upcoming game "Turok: Evolution."



        



A PR rep from Acclaim, Alan Lewis, said such promotions are part of what it takes to stand out in a crowded market. For example, when the GameCube was gearing up for release, Nintendo had a "What would you do for a GameCube?" contest involving eating pet food, and they celebrated the release of "Mario Sunshine" with fans diving into a tonne of pasta for prizes. Altering Time is planning a promotion of even greater scale, in which they block off random freeways and set up an exhibition. "There will be one of those huge tents, like in carnivals," said a spokesperson for AT. "The Official Altering Time Publicity Stunt Exhibition will have demonstrations of such things as the health dangers of Q Codec 7, really nicely treated cows and chickens, Sean hating people, and a real-life demonstration of the [Flash Stick Fight](/silliness/stickfight.php). To top it all off, anyone who legally names their baby 'http://www.alteringtime.com/' will get $50." An analyst with ZWS Industries pointed out that a $50 prize open to everyone is more valuable than a $10 000 prize open to one person. "There's 6 000 000 000 people in the world, times $50," said the analyst. "I don't know how much more than $10 000 that is, but it hurts to think about it."



        



Ways to scam Acclaim's promotion are already in the works. By definition 2B in the [Merriam Webster](http://www.m-w.com/) dictionary, a baby is "something that is one's special responsibility, achievement, or interest." This of course means that Altering Time is a baby. Considering definition 1B of birth, "the act or process of bringing forth young from the womb," we think our case is quite undisputable. What our case is, however, is a different story completely. A local lawyer backs us up, however, making such affirmative statements as, "You guys are out of your freaking minds," and, "This is a waste of my time." While the second statement is in a grey area, we're sure the first statement is great news. The lawyer, oddly, didn't want us to quote his name.

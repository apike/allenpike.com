Internet Explorer is always [a source for fun bugs](http://www.fleegix.org/articles/2007-08-04-ie-background-css-and-onclick-onmousedown):


> In IE (both IE6 and IE7), absolute-positioned block elements that have no background set (i.e., no `background`, `background-color`, or `background-image`) do not trigger click or mousedown DOM events.


Easy to forget, easy to be burnt by.

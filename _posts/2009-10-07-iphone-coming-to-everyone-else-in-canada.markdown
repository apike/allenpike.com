As you may know, we only have two wireless networks in Canada. One network is run by Telus in the west and Bell in the east, resold as Virgin, Koodo, and Solo; the other is Rogers', which is resold as Fido. Hence the fanfare as [Bell](http://www.bce.ca/en/news/releases/bm/2009/10/06/75222.html) and [Telus](http://about.telus.com/cgi-bin/media_news_viewer.cgi?news_id=1135&mode=2) confirm rumors that they're launching the iPhone and GSM networks use them on in the coming weeks. Although the death of CDMA in Canada was a inevitability, it's interesting to see it come before the 4G/LTE networks that were supposed to provide an upgrade path for old CDMA handsets. Good news for all Canadians, except maybe people holding their breath for 4G.

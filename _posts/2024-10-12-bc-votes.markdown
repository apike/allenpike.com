Voting is now open for BC’s election, which concludes in one week on Sat Oct 19.

I’ve done voting guides for Vancouver and Canada in the past, but I’ve never done a BC one since the decision here has traditionally been simple. There has long been two viable parties: one on the left, and one on the right. This continues, with no centrist party on the ticket and the Green Party unviable in almost every riding.

The main difference this time is that instead of the center-right BC Liberals, the NDP now faces the actually-right BC Conservative Party. While they might not have seemed electable only a few weeks ago, this recently-fringe party has been downplaying and walking back some of their more extreme statements in the hope of assuaging centrists who would have voted Liberal.

With such a [close race](https://338canada.com/bc/) between two very different choices, the outcome will ultimately come down to who turns up.

If you live in BC, **make a plan to vote** this week. Early voting continues on Sunday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, with the final decision on Sat Oct 19.

Today Jane Wells at Automattic posted a [report on their usability testing for the WordPress admin panel](http://wordpress.org/development/2008/10/usability-testing-report-25-and-crazyhorse/). Not only are they addressing most of my Wordpress UI gripes, they're also showing great leadership in usability work for open source software.

Let's have a round of applause for the guys at [Mobify.me](http://mobify.me/), who launched the mobile version of [A List Apart](http://m.alistapart.com/) today. It's [a lot of fun](http://igorfaletski.com/2009/03/29/start-up-moments/) watching guys you've hung with since university go out there and kick some real butt.

Jon Stokes over at Ars thinks [Kindle eBook reader](http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Amazons-Wireless-Reading-Device/dp/B000FI73MA) has "missed the mark by a mile" since [it doesn't display two pages side by side](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20071125-books-vs-documents-whats-wrong-with-so-called-ebooks.html):


> Design all e-book readers to display pairs of pages in the traditional, facing-page format in which books were designed to be read. Sure, it would cost more money, but there are those of us who would pay more to read _books_ using new technology as opposed to flipping back and forth through mere multipage documents.


When I first read this I dismissed it as a lone oddball opinion, but [John Gruber seems to agree](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/november#tue-27-stokes). I might be crazy, but I don't really _want_ to see two pages side by side. I love typography too, but being twice the size and more expensive is the absolute last thing the $400 Kindle needs. Mind you, they're out of stock until next year, so somebody's buying them. The more I read and think about eBook readers, the more my initial "Don't touch my books and get off my lawn!" reaction fades, and I can imagine a world where books go the way of CDs.

Accidentally sending an email before it's ready can suck. That's why Google ((Via [acangiano](http://antoniocangiano.com/).)) is [debuting an Undo Send feature](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2009/03/new-in-labs-undo-send.html):


> you’ll see a new “Undo” link on every sent mail confirmation. Click “Undo,” and we’ll grab the message before it’s sent and take you right back to compose.


A very simple solution to what seemed like an impossible problem.

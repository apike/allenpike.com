Advance voting is now open for Canada’s federal election.

The last federal election was boring – but a lot has changed. The two largest parties have new leaders, and Canada’s largest trading partner has, uh, put new issues on voters’ minds.

While defense, energy independence, international relations, and democracy itself have hardly been core election issues of late, they’re now in play. You can check out CBC’s [Election platform overview](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/features/2025/federal-party-platforms/#federal-election-health-care) or [Vote Compass](https://votecompass.cbc.ca/), or the [CTV’s Party Platform Tracker](https://www.ctvnews.ca/federal-election-2025/party-platforms/) to get a recap of the parties’ platforms.

In terms of what to expect, there has been a fairly dramatic polling shift since Justin Trudeau’s resignation and the new US administration coming to power. According to polls, many voters who planned to vote for other parties – whether it was Conservatives, the progressive NDP, or the more obscure parties – are now planning to back the centre-left Liberals. Of course, only those who show up actually decide.

You can use [338Canada](https://338canada.com/) to see some guesses about what this might mean for your riding, or any strategic voting. Given the very large error bars on these projections though, it’s worth remembering that at the end of the day, you’re electing an MP to represent you – not the Prime Minister directly.

## Making a plan to vote

- **Sun April 20, Sat April 21**: Remaining [advance voting](https://www.elections.ca/scripts/vis/FindED?L=e&PAGEID=20) days
- **Mon, Apr 28**: [Voting Day](https://www.elections.ca/content2.aspx?section=vote&document=index&lang=e). Polls will be open until 9:30 for Eastern Time ridings, but only 7pm in Pacific time areas. Make a plan if you’re not advance voting.

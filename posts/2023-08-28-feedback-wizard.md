We had fun this month making a little experiment called [The Feedback Wizard](https://feedbackwizard.steamclock.com/). It’s a tool that helps you (or your reports) take a problem you’ve seen and transform it into useful feedback.

It’s been well received by our early users, both for its ability to phrase feedback in an empathetic but clear way, and for its resilience in the face of surprising inputs.

I hope you and your teams find it useful. Feedback welcome!

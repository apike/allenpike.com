For a summary of what I do, see [my resume](http://www.allenpike.com/resume/). What follows is a catalog of most of the things I've done so far. You could think of it as the world's most disastrously long and self-deprecating resume.

**Current Projects**

Since we started Steamclock, I've usually worked on a new type of project every month. We love working on our own apps, but client work can be fun too.

* **[Party Monster](http://www.steamclock.com/partymonster/)**: A queueing DJ app for parties and road trips. We made a [funky video](http://www.allenpike.com/2012/making-a-funky-app-video/) for it as well.

* **[WeddingDJ](http://www.steamclock.com/weddingdj/)**: The best darn iPhone app for running music at weddings.

* **[Consulting work](http://www.steamclock.com/services/)**: We help companies ship great mobile apps. Some of my interesting client projects at Steamclock have been:

	* an interactive 3D map of the internet
	* an international mountain conditions app
	* an app for running rental and accommodation businesses
	* a realtime video chat app
	* apps for security analysis on iOS and Android
	* an app for configuring solar-powered lights using Bluetooth
	* many photo sharing apps (people *love* photo sharing apps)
	* work on the ill-fated webOS app store
	* a JavaScript app for Fortune 500 company
	* a web app for doing developer support on Stack Overflow
	* an iPhone app for finding fresh food
	* an interactive retail app
	* a system for running valet businesses
	* an Android app for tracking commercial fishing
	* an iPhone app for ordering bespoke suits.

* **[Up Up Down Down](http://upup.fm/)**: A podcast about the craft of video games.

* **Meetups**: I started the [Vancouver Javascript Developers](http://www.vanjs.com) group, and the related [VanCocoa iOS meetup](http://www.vancocoa.com/).

* **Not being at a computer**: I play ice hockey, play guitar, act, and otherwise dabble in the world away from computers. There is nothing to link here, which is for the best.

**Talks and Podcast Appearances**

I love teaching and discussing tech and other topics. <a href="/me/">Sometimes, people record it.</a>

**Older Steamclock-era Projects** (2010-2015)

* **[Prism](http://www.steamclock.com/blog/2014/10/goodbye-prism/)**: We shipped and later retired a photo browser for iPad that excelled at showing photos of kittens.

* **Unladen Follow**: I created a tool to unfollow the most annoying people on Twitter. It was semi-broken by Twitter's 1.1 API changes, but I'd love to bring it back one day.

* **Prototypes**: Lots of interesting prototypes haven't made it out of the Steamclock labs - for example an antisocial Facebook app, a Git client for Mac, and a turn-based strategy game.

* **CMPT 470**: I've twice taught the 4th-year Web Technologies course for SFU's Computing Science department. In doing so, I learned that I love teaching and hate grading.

* **Training**: I've taught training courses and workshops for companies such as Mobify and Clio.

**Apple Era Projects** (2008-2010)

For reasons I don't fully understand, Apple offered me a job in 2008. I never thought I'd make a detour into working for a large company, but it was a fun ride.

* **[iWork for iPad](http://www.apple.com/ipad/features/pages.html)**: I worked on the iWork iPad apps, primarily writing Objective-C to support iWork.com. Having a secret iPad prototype locked in my desk was possibly the most ridiculous thing ever.

* **iWork.com**: I wrote JavaScript, CSS, and Objective-C for rich web app that helped proof iWork documents. Lots and lots of JavaScript.

* **Prototypes**: Working on product prototypes that don't ship is as fun and frustrating as it sounds. Over beer you should totally not ask me for NDA-violating war stories on this topic.

* **Websites for Fun**: I'm often making websites for fun, for example for a local theatre company, a WoW guild, and [my wedding](http://karen.and.allenpike.com/). If there's one thing I've learned about this, it's to use a static site generator and not have to worry about updating Wordpress for the rest of your life.




**Discovery Era Projects** (2003-2008)


My first real tech job was at a small software company that builds apps for education. I'd been a friend of the company since the late .com era, letting me watch them explode, implode, and rebuild over most of a decade.

* **DiscoNet**: My main job at Discovery was creating and iterating the company intranet and CRM system. I had a lot of freedom with this project, as evidenced by the fact I was somehow allowed to name it DiscoNet. Disco would later [resurface as a theme](http://www.allenpike.com/2012/making-a-funky-app-video/) in my software work.

* **Learn Faces**: I built a game for school staff to learn students' names and faces using JavaScript. Which is pretty random.

* **Principalm:** Before mobile apps were cool, Principalm ran on Palm m500s off of 16MB SD cards. It was SO COOL. I did QA, branding and design work, and other product-related tasks for it, giving me my first taste of product management.

* **Just Ask Oldguy**: I designed a Q&A site where my former boss answered random questions from the internet.

* **Budgetable**: I built a [financial management site](http://www.allenpike.com/2006/whats-a-budgetable/), and then sold the domain to a team who is [actually going somewhere with it](http://www.budgetable.com/).

**University Era Projects** (2002-2008)

I started university at UCFV, but I upgraded to SFU within a year to preserve my sanity. I learned something from my courses, but I learned more from the crazy side projects I would take on.

* **[Altering Time](/altering-time/)**: What started as a forum turned into a long-running community site. It included multiplayer strategy games and user-generated content - before it was cool.

* **[Political Asylum](http://www.allenpike.com/political-asylum/)**: My first multiplayer game, Asylum was a rat's nest of PHP and MySQL supported some wicked political machinations. 

* **[Engineering Faith](http://www.allenpike.com/engineering-faith/)**: Excited by the success of Asylum, I built a second game about creating your own religion. It was very well architected, but I forgot to make it fun. Oops.

* **SFU CSSS**: I spent time as the VP Operations, Acting President, and Secretary of the Computing Science Student Society. I have since retired from politics.

* **The Cascade**: During my year at UCFV, I wrote articles for the university newspaper. This was the peak of my stint in journalism.

* **[Gender Quiz](http://quiz.alteringtime.com/)**: I built this somewhat better than random-guessing AI project almost entirely out of SQL. If that's not a case of seeing a nail because you have a hammer, I'm not sure what is.

* **[Modeling Plants with L-Systems](http://www.antipode.ca/461/project/)**: This project on generating 3D plants for SFU's CMPT 461/761 class gets me both a crazy amount of traffic from Google and occasional emails from scientific journals. If you're looking for a research topic in graphics, I suggest plants!

* **Other Project Courses**: I took all the project classes I could in school. Besides the plants and bizarro gender quiz, I built a small distributed system, a pinball game, a raytracer, a student society website, a Java compiler, an STV voting system, and 3D fireworks simulation in C#. All of these were bad.

* **Freelance web development**: For the better part of a year I did solo web contracting, and [learned many lessons](http://www.allenpike.com/2009/the-california-guys/) on the way. I built sites for my mom's work (a credit union), a construction company, a venture investor, a project management startup, and my stepmom's doggy daycare. It was, uh, world-class.

**High School and Earlier** (1990s)

* **Uniserve Intranet**: Besides being a Customer Service guy, I built the intranet at the local ISP where I worked. I do not know why they let me do this.

* **Improv**: In high school one of my favourite things to do was improv. The premise was to travel to other high schools and make an ass of yourself in a comedic and competitive manner. We got to the provincial championships, but suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of slightly more ridiculous high school kids.

* **[ACSS Theatre Company Video](/2002/the-theatre-company-movie/)**: This ancient nostalgic video has a horror story attached to it that should have scared me off of taking on large projects in the future. It did not.


* **[FantasyTech 3](http://www.allenpike.com/2006/fantasytech-3-goto-fun/)**: I wrote a giant text-based RPG in QBASIC. How is this not on my resume?

* **WarTech**: I was likely the only person ever to make a turn-based strategy in C++Builder. My friends lauded it as "kind of fun".

* **So many games**: I'm not sure what my most catastrophic failure to make a game was during childhood. It may have been the time where I tried to write an entire RPG in a 10,000 line C++ if statement.


* **The Essence**: For some reason I designed my own (bad) trading card game, creating a couple hundred cards, many featuring (bad) art.


* **Spellbook**: I ran a low-budget games magazine with my friends for a couple years. When I say low-budget, I mean photocopying at the 7-11. The first issue was taped with masking tape. I was like 12, okay?!


* **Street Vending**: In elementary school I enjoyed putting a table on the street and failing to sell lemonade and hockey cards to passers-by. I even kept a ledger of the lemonade I failed to sell. This was all of the lemonade.

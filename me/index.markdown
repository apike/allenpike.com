I love creating things and perfecting products. I run [Steamclock Software](http://www.steamclock.com), where we build polished web and mobile apps in Vancouver. Previously, I was a Software Engineer at Apple.

My job involves product design, development, teaching, and speaking. I'm intensely interested in how great software can be. In my downtime, I play guitar, host a podcast, and play on a hockey team comprised entirely of programmers.

**Projects**

* [Steamclock Software](http://www.steamclock.com/): We make products for clients as well as ourselves. We also have [a blog](http://www.steamclock.com/blog/), where we show our work.
* [Party Monster](http://www.steamclock.com/partymonster/): An iOS app for running music at parties and road trips.
* [WeddingDJ](http://www.steamclock.com/weddingdj/): An iOS app for planning and running the music at weddings.
* [VanCocoa](http://www.vancocoa.com/): The Vancouver Cocoa speaker series.
* [VanJS](http://www.vanjs.com/): The Vancouver JavaScript speaker series.
* [My resume](/resume/): What one would expect.
* [Project List](/projects/): An exhaustive catalog of most things I've worked on.

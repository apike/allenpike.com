I love creating things and perfecting products. I'm co-founder of [Steamclock Software](http://www.steamclock.com), where we build polished web and mobile apps in Vancouver. Prior to that, I was a Software Engineer at Apple.

My job involves product design, development, teaching, and speaking. I'm intensely interested in how great software can be. In my downtime, I play on a hockey team comprised entirely of programmers.

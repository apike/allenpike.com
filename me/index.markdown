I love building products and teams. I run [Steamclock Software](http://www.steamclock.com), where we build very nice iOS and Android apps in Vancouver. Previously, I was a Software Engineer at Apple.

My job involves managing products, developing software, building teams, and [sharing what I know](/speaking). I care a lot about great software, and the people that make it. In my downtime, I play music, record podcasts, and write.

If you have feedback on my writing or another inquiry, [please reach out](https://allenpike.com/contact/).

**Things I've Made**

* [Steamclock Software](http://www.steamclock.com/): We make products for clients as well as ourselves. We also have [a blog](http://www.steamclock.com/blog/), where we show our work.
* [Public Speaking and Podcasts](/speaking/): I like to talk, often about software.
* [It Shipped That Way](https://www.itshipped.fm/), a podcast where I interview product leaders about what they've learned.
* [Two Spies](https://www.steamclock.com/spies/): A turn-based spy strategy game.
* [Fun Fact](https://funfact.fm/): A podcast I do monthly, about facts.
* [Vancouver Xcoders](https://www.meetup.com/Vancouver-Xcoders/): Our local iOS and Mac speaker series.
* [My resume](/resume/): Obligatory, I suppose.
* [Project List](/projects/): An exhaustive catalog of most things I've worked on.

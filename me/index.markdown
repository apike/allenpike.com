I’m a founder who loves building great software. Currently, I'm building a new product startup, [Forestwalk](https://forestwalk.ai/), helping teams build and test LLM-powered software. Previously I founded [Steamclock](https://steamclock.com/), and was a Software Engineer at Apple.

I also [write monthly about what I'm learning](/archive/), host a podcast [about leadership](https://itshipped.fm), [speak](/speaking/) about what I’ve learned, organize an [AI engineering meetup called Infer](https://infervan.com/), and informally advise startups.

Outside of work, I like to play music, overdo things, write, and play games where I make numbers go up.

I like hearing from people! Go ahead and [send me a short note](/contact/), or you can [follow my work](/subscribe/).

**Current Projects**

- [Forestwalk](https://forestwalk.ai/): I’ve recently co-founded an early-stage startup building LLM-powered tools for teams.
- [It Shipped That Way](https://www.itshipped.fm/), a podcast where I interview product and tech leaders.
- [Infer](https://infervan.com/), an AI speaker series in Vancouver.
- [Public Speaking and Appearances](/speaking/): I like to share what I’ve learned.
- [Steamclock](https://steamclock.com/): I’m on the board of this product studio I founded, which makes very nice apps.
- [The Feedback Wizard](https://feedbackwizard.steamclock.com/), a little LLM experiment.

**Historical Projects**

- [Fun Fact](https://funfact.fm/): A podcast I did monthly, about facts.
- [Two Spies](https://playspies.com): A turn-based spy strategy game.
- [My resume](/resume/): Obligatory, I suppose.
- [Full Project List](/projects/): An exhaustive catalog of most things I've worked on.

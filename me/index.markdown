I love creating things and perfecting products. I run [Steamclock Software](http://www.steamclock.com), where we build polished web and mobile apps in Vancouver. Previously, I was a Software Engineer at Apple.

My job involves product design, development, leadership, and [speaking](/speaking). I care a lot about great software, and the teams that make it. In my downtime, I play guitar, podcast, and play on a hockey team comprised entirely of programmers.

**Projects**

* [Steamclock Software](https://steamclock.com/): We make products for clients as well as ourselves. We also have [a blog](http://www.steamclock.com/blog/), where we show our work.
* [Fun Fact](https://funfact.fm/), the podcast I co-host with Arik Devens.
* [Public Speaking and Podcasts](/speaking/): For better or worse, I like to talk.

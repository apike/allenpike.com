I love creating things and perfecting products. I run [Steamclock Software](http://www.steamclock.com), where we build polished mobile and web apps in Vancouver. Previously, I was a Software Engineer at Apple.

My job involves product design, development, leadership, and [speaking](/speaking). I care a lot about great software, and the teams that make it. In my downtime, I play guitar, podcast, and make games.

**Projects**

* [Steamclock Software](http://www.steamclock.com/): We make products for clients as well as ourselves. We also have [a blog](http://www.steamclock.com/blog/), where we show our work.
* [Public Speaking and Podcasts](/speaking/): I like to talk, often about software.
* [Fun Fact](https://funfact.fm/): A podcast I do every other Friday.

* [VanJS](http://www.vanjs.com/): The Vancouver JavaScript speaker series.

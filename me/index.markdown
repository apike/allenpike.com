I’m a founder who loves building great products and teams, currently spinning up a new product startup. Previously I founded [Steamclock](https://steamclock.com/), a studio in Vancouver that builds nice apps, and was a Software Engineer at Apple.

I also [write monthly about technology and teams](/archive/), host a podcast [about leadership](https://itshipped.fm) and one [about facts](https://funfact.fm), [speak](/speaking/) about what I’ve learned, and informally advise startups.

Outside of work, I like to play music poorly, learn in great depth about topics that will likely never affect my life, and play games where I make numbers go up.

I like hearing from people, so go ahead and [send me a short note](/contact/) or you can [follow my work](/subscribe/).

**Current Projects**

* [Forestwalk](https://forestwalk.ai/): I’ve just co-founded an early-stage startup building tools for software teams.
* [Steamclock](https://steamclock.com/): A product studio that makes very nice apps.
* [It Shipped That Way](https://www.itshipped.fm/), a podcast where I interview product and tech leaders.
* [Public Speaking and Appearances](/speaking/): I like to share what I’ve learned.

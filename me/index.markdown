I love creating things and perfecting products. I run [Steamclock Software](http://www.steamclock.com), where we build polished web and mobile apps in Vancouver. Previously, I was a Software Engineer at Apple.

My job involves product design, development, teaching, and [speaking](http://lanyrd.com/profile/apike/). I'm intensely interested in how great software can be. In my downtime, I play on a hockey team comprised entirely of programmers.

**More About Me**
* My [blog](/), where I write about technology and crap like that.
* My [Twitter page](https://twitter.com/apike), where I retweet people who are smarter than me.

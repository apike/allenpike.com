I’m a founder who loves building great products and teams. I run [Steamclock](https://steamclock.com/), a mobile product studio in Vancouver that builds nice apps. I now lead our new product discovery work, exploring new businesses where UX can be a competitive advantage.

I also [write monthly about technology and teams](/archive/), host a podcast [about leadership](https://itshipped.fm) and one [about facts](https://funfact.fm), [speak](/speaking/) about what I’ve learned, and informally advise startups.

I like hearing from people, so go ahead and [send me a short note](/contact/) or you can [follow my work](/subscribe/).

**Current Projects**

* [Steamclock](https://steamclock.com/): We make apps for clients and ourselves – and have [a blog](http://www.steamclock.com/blog/).
* [It Shipped That Way](https://www.itshipped.fm/), a podcast where I interview product leaders about what they’ve learned.
* [Public Speaking and Appearances](/speaking/): I like to share what I’ve learned.
* [Fun Fact](https://funfact.fm/): A podcast I do monthly, about facts.
* [The Feedback Wizard](https://feedbackwizard.steamclock.com/), a little LLM experiment.
 
**Historical Projects**

* [Vancouver Xcoders](https://www.meetup.com/Vancouver-Xcoders/): Our local iOS and Mac speaker series.
* [Two Spies](https://playspies.com): A turn-based spy strategy game.
* [My resume](/resume/): Obligatory, I suppose.
* [Full Project List](/projects/): An exhaustive catalog of most things I've worked on.

I love creating things and perfecting products. I run [Steamclock Software](http://www.steamclock.com), where we build polished web and mobile apps in Vancouver. Previously, I was a Software Engineer at Apple.

My job involves product design, development, teaching, and speaking. I'm intensely interested in how great software can be. In my downtime, I play guitar, host a podcast, and play on a hockey team comprised entirely of programmers.

**My Writing**

* [My blog](/archive/), where I tell stories about technology and products.
* [My Twitter page](https://twitter.com/apike), for sarcastic quips and updates when I ship things.
* [The Steamclock blog](http://www.steamclock.com/blog/), where my colleagues and I show our work.
